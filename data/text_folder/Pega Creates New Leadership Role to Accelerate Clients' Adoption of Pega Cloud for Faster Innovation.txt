According to IDC , worldwide spending on public cloud services is forecasted to reach $805 billion in 2024 and double in size by 2028.

Scalability and efficiency: Pega Cloud operates as a service so clients can scale their infrastructure based on need and only pay for what they use. They can also increase efficiency by offloading maintenance tasks, freeing up IT teams for more strategic initiatives.
