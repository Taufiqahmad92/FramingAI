To provide the Congress with a comprehensive review of its work, the Congressional Budget Office publishes quarterly reports that highlight the agency's recent publications and summarize its work in progress./1
Over the past three months, CBO has produced a variety of budget and economic analyses, fulfilling the agency's core mission of supporting the Congress during each stage of the legislative process. The agency's work takes many forms, including technical assistance to committees and Members when they are crafting legislation, cost estimates of legislation, testimonies, reports, and other analytic products.
Recent Cost Estimates
Through its technical assistance and cost estimates, CBO routinely provides the Congress with information about the effects of proposed legislation on the federal budget. The agency is required by law to prepare a cost estimate for nearly every bill that is approved by a full Congressional committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate. The agency publishes cost estimates at other stages of the legislative process, too, if requested to do so by a relevant committee or by Congressional leadership. Also, CBO estimates the budgetary effects of bills scheduled to be considered under suspension of the rules in the House, a procedure sometimes used to consider legislation on the House floor in an expedited manner./2
This past quarter, the agency published 316 cost estimates, including these:
* A cost estimate for H.R. 8467, the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024, which would reauthorize and amend agricultural support, nutrition, conservation, and other programs implemented and administered by the Department of Agriculture;
* A cost estimate for H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which would repeal the windfall elimination provision, which can reduce Social Security benefits for people who also receive benefits from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes, and eliminate the government pension offset, which can reduce Social Security benefits for spouses who also receive government pensions of their own; and
* A cost estimate for H.R. 7986, the Generalized System of Preferences Reform Act, which would apply (including retroactively) reduced duties on goods imported under an updated version of the government's Generalized System of Preferences program through December 31, 2030, and extend current customs user fees through September 30, 2033.
* * *
1. For previous editions of this report, see www.cbo.gov/taxonomy/term/3/recurring-reports.
2. In addition, the agency prepares cost estimates when a bill is the subject of a motion to be placed on the Consensus Calendar--an alternative route to the floor for certain House bills and resolutions that enjoy broad bipartisan support.
* * *
Recent Analytic Products
In addition to cost estimates, CBO has released 27 testimonies, reports, and other analytic products since publishing its last quarterly report on the agency's work in progress (see Table 1 on page 6).
A number of those products provided an analysis of or information on the nation's budgetary and economic situation:
* Testimony on the CBO's current projections of the economy and federal budget for 2024 to 2034;
* Testimony on the agency's analysis of Social Security's finances;
* A report describing the agency's 2024 long-term projections for Social Security;
* A recurring report describing the agency's current estimates of the cost of federal credit programs in 2025;
* A report about the effects of immigration on CBO's baseline budget projections; and
* A slide deck describing inflation from 2020 to 2023, highlighting the patterns and types of prices most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
In addition, each month since the previous edition of the agency's Work in Progress, CBO has issued its Monthly Budget Review of federal spending and revenues for the preceding month and the fiscal year to date. The agency also issued its annual report on expired and expiring authorizations of appropriations for the fiscal year, and an update on whether or not sequestration is needed, that is, whether or not budgetary resources have exceeded caps and therefore need to be canceled.
Three publications explored topics in national security:
* A visual report analyzing the availability and use of the Army's aircraft,
* A visual report comparing the military services' costs for deferred maintenance of buildings, and
* A report providing CBO's estimates of the cost of the Coast Guard's Polar Security Cutter.
Four publications examined topics related to climate change and disaster risk:
* A report assessing the amount of flood damage avoided by federal spending on adaptations,
* A report evaluating the effects of climate change and disaster risk on homeowner's insurance,
* A visual report describing the distribution of flood insurance coverage by income and by demographic and other characteristics, and
* A working paper estimating how flood risk and expected damage affect the costs of federally backed mortgages.
Several publications analyzed topics related to borrowing and income:
* A report documenting differences in the repayment of student loans for several recent cohorts of borrowers and
* A visual report presenting the distribution of household income, means-tested transfers (benefits based on income), and federal taxes in 2021, along with a companion document examining the associated trends from 1979 through 2021.
Two publications explained analytic methods that CBO uses in its work or provided background information about the work:
* A report about public-private risk sharing in federal credit programs and
* A report discussing CBO's projections of housing starts over the next 30 years.
CBO's Director testified before the House Budget Committee on CBO's operations and how the agency supports the Congress.
CBO also responded to questions from Members of Congress:
* Answers to questions for the record, part 1 and part 2, from the Senate Budget Committee following the testimony on CBO's updated budget and economic projections;
* Answers to questions for the record following CBO's testimony on Social Security's finances; and
* A letter providing the agency's assessment of the distributional effects of raising the full retirement age.
In addition, CBO posted on its website presentations that were given by the agency's staff and updated models and code.
Work in Progress
As of September 30, 2024, CBO was preparing 337 cost estimates, nearly all of which are for legislation that has been approved by a committee (see Table 2 on page 7). The agency was also working on 30 analytic products that it expects to complete in the coming months.
Seven recurring reports were in progress as of September 30:
* The Monthly Budget Review: September 2024 (released on October 8),
* The Analysis of the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2025 (released on October 4),
* Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 2034 (to be released in late 2024),
* Long-Term Implications of the 2025 Future Years Defense Program (to be released later this fall),
* An Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2025 Shipbuilding Plan (to be released later this fall),
* The Accuracy of CBO's Baseline Projections for Fiscal Year 2025 (to be released in late 2024), and
* Automatic Stabilizers in the Federal Budget: 2024to 2034 (to be released later this fall).
Twelve products requested by Members of Congress were in progress as of September 30:
* A report describing CBO's approach to analyzing policies that would increase Medicare's coverage of treatments for obesity (released on October 8);
* A report assessing alternative approaches to reducing prescription drug prices (released on October 4);
* A report explaining CBO's approach to estimating the budgetary effects of increased gene therapy treatment for sickle cell disease;
* A report assessing how extending Medicaid's continuous eligibility for children would affect the economy and the budget;
* A report describing health insurance coverage by small businesses and those businesses' options for offering coverage;
* A report presenting potential policy responses to the opioid crisis;
* A report describing spending and sources of growth in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which allows certain hospitals and other entities that serve low-income or underserved populations to purchase outpatient prescription drugs at a discount;
* A report comparing the number of people below poverty thresholds using alternative definitions of income;
* A report summarizing the risks that climate change poses to the federal budget and the economy;
* A visual report examining patterns in the availability and use of rotary-wing aircraft for all branches in the Department of Defense;
* A report on the effects of immigration on the budgets of state and local governments; and
* A report providing an overview of artificial intelligence and the federal budget.
CBO was preparing answers to two requests for specific information:
* A letter providing information about spending for emergency services under Medicaid (released on October 2) and
* A letter about demonstration projects in Medicare's Part D program (released on October 2).
Other in-progress products will explain analytic methods that CBO uses in its work, provide background information about that work, or provide the Congress with analyses of policy issues:
* A report describing how, in its analyses, CBO selects and uses discount rates (or rates of interest used to translate future cash flows into current dollars) (released on October 7);
* A report describing the distribution of family wealth (released on October 2);
* A slide deck describing how CBO projects revenues from tariffs (released on October 2);
* A report explaining the methods underlying CBO's projections of the costs of future defense programs;
* A visual report describing trends in the distribution of rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers in Medicare's Part D program;
* A report examining how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac achieve their housing goals through the fees they charge for mortgages;
* A report analyzing how taxes affect investment in wind and solar electric power generation;
* A report assessing the quality of the baseline projections of deficits and debt that CBO has made each spring from 1984 to 2023; and
* A working paper describing the relationship between changes to federal fiscal policy and near-term growth of real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product.
CBO's upcoming releases and published reports are available on the agency's website.
