Team CACI named key partner for NGAs commercial Earth observation program
Intermap advances AI/ML innovation in geospatial intelligence
DENVER, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intermap Technologies (TSX: IMP; OTCQB: ITMSF) (Intermap or the Company), a global leader in 3D geospatial products and intelligence solutions, today announced that, in partnership with CACI, Inc.  Federal (CACI), its team has been selected by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) as one of 10 qualified vendors for the Luno A program.
Luno A, a new NGA initiative, focuses on providing continually updated, low-latency foundation data to support critical national security indicators. This program represents a significant advancement from the previous Economic Indicator Monitoring (EIM) effort, which began in 2021. Luno A aims to enhance U.S. National Security Community (NSC) insights by leveraging commercial satellite data to monitor a range of factors, including economic activities, military capabilities and environmental conditions. With recent advancements in computer vision and AI-driven geospatial intelligence, Luno A will integrate these technologies to provide real-time, actionable intelligence directly into NSCs analytic workflows.
The Luno A contract, valued at up to $290 million over five years, marks a substantial increase from the initial EIM budget of $29 million and the previously planned $60 million ceiling. This growth underscores the expanding role of unclassified computer vision capabilities within U.S. government operations.
Further to the previous announcement on June 16, 2021, Team CACIs next-generation platform will combine Intermaps patented IRIS processing suite with CACIs Feature Trace software. This integration will leverage advanced geospatial AI/ML models to deliver precise, near-real-time feature datasets, reflecting dynamic changes in land usage and infrastructure. This technology can be used standalone to generate insights for analysts as well as powering DEM and map sheet updates through change detection of manmade and natural features.
This award builds on Intermaps strategic partnerships with U.S. government agencies and their key suppliers, including NGA, the Pentagon, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Affairs and NASA.
We are pleased to partner with CACI on the Luno A program and contribute to advancing real-life, 3D computer vision capabilities for the NSC, said Patrick A. Blott, Chairman and CEO of Intermap. Our proprietary processing suite, combined with CACIs technologies, will add context to analytic assessments and power unparalleled insight for national security.
