Your excellencies,
Distinguished participants,
It's a real privilege to be here today, and I welcome this first ever dedicated conversation in the G7 on disability rights.
Persons with disabilities in all their diversity are the largest marginalized group in the world, representing 16% of the population - facing discrimination in all of life.
Almost all G7 States, with US being a signatory, are parties to the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities - a transformative document that sets out legal obligations to address the inequalities experienced by persons with disabilities.
Inclusion is the right thing to do, because together with diversity and respect for the other, these are a strength for any society.
However, all too often, the legal frameworks to ensure inclusion of persons with disabilities are insufficient or non-existent.
And even where policy initiatives and national plans exist, implementation lags behind
Simply put, the rights of persons with disabilities are rarely central to governance and policies across all spheres of life in most countries.
At best, they are an afterthought.
And we must do better.
Because when persons with disabilities are able to fully engage, unleash their capabilities and realise their potential, we all gain from their contribution, we are enriched by their achievements in the face of enormous challenges, as we heard so powerfully yesterday from Francesca to Enrico and Julia, and little Anna's family - you are all indeed champions!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Exclusion can have catastrophic consequences: take crisis settings for example where being left behind is a reality all too visible from Sudan to Haiti; Gaza to Ukraine, as raging conflict leaves greater numbers of persons with disabilities in its wake, as inaccessibility of essential services in such settings quickly becomes a death sentence, and as people with disabilities are excluded from early warning systems, disaster response strategies, and recovery plans.
And there are more insidious consequences:
COVID-19 exposed the enormous gaps faced globally by care systems, so the increased focus in recent years on the care and support economy is a welcome step.
And yet, those who receive care and support, including persons with disabilities, are still not fully included in these policy discussions as equal partners.
Their inclusion would underscore the need for income security to cover extra costs, such as personal assistance, accessible housing, and housing adjustments;
They would focus on the staggering rates of unemployment and inactivity rates for persons with disabilities;
Also the importance of addressing the impact of digital technologies on persons with disabilities.
There is a human rights framework which offers us valuable guidance in all of these areas.
To ensure people with disabilities are fully included in this digital revolution, with sufficient efforts and investments made to close the digital divide.
and to ensure that AI technologies are developed in ways that enhance accessibility, not aggravate barriers, respecting the right to privacy.
AI plays a transformative role in assistive technologies, only if governments and tech companies adopt co-design principles from the outset and involving persons with disabilities in the development of these systems
Distinguished participants,
Last month, the leadership and efforts of G7 members to include persons with disabilities in the Pact for the Future and the Declaration for Future Generations were a major step forward, and we welcome these efforts.
We need to continue on this productive path together.
I am encouraged by the commitments that were already heard.
I want to reiterate the outcome of today's discussions must not be a one off. We look to you to start a valuable cascade: to leverage these discussions to build momentum.
By the time we celebrate 20 years of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2026, we need to see that these efforts yield concrete results in the lived experience of people with disabilities the world over.
Moving forward, we look to all of you to commit to three key steps as a starting point:
1) Ensure that, as they do today, persons with disabilities have a seat at the table in the G7;
2) Commit to addressing disability rights in international processes leading up to the post-2030 agenda, including the G20 and the 2025 UN Social Summit; and
3) Continue to strengthen disability rights in care and support economy efforts through enhanced international cooperation and political support.
Today, we have the opportunity to advance practical, human rights-based solutions that will transform the lives of millions of persons with disabilities and society at large if we make inclusion a priority.
I hope we work together to turn that promise, and their aspirations into reality.
Thank you.
