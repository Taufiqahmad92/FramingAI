In exercising this delegated authority, the Board is directed to take every reasonable step to solicit comment. In determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies.
During the comment period for this proposal, a copy of the proposed PRA OMB submission, including the draft reporting form and instructions, supporting statement (which contains more detail about the information collection and burden estimates than this notice), and other documentation, will be made available on the Board's public website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/ apps/ reportingforms/ home/ review or may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose name appears above. On the page displayed at the link above, you can find the supporting information by referencing the collection identifier, FR 1401. Final versions of these documents will be made available at https://www.reginfo.gov/ public/ do/ PRAMain, if approved.
Request for Comment on Information Collection Proposal
The Board invites public comment on the following information collection, which is being reviewed under authority delegated by the OMB under the PRA. Comments are invited on the following:
a. Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the Board's functions, including whether the information has practical utility;
b. The accuracy of the Board's estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;
c. Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected;
d. Ways to minimize the burden of information collection on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and
e. Estimates of capital or startup costs and costs of operation, maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information.
At the end of the comment period, the comments and recommendations received will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the Board should modify the proposal.
Proposal Under OMB Delegated Authority To Extend for Three Years, With Revision, the Following Information Collection
Collection title: Application Form for Membership on the Community Advisory Council.
Collection identifier: FR 1401.
OMB control number:7100-0371.
General description of collection: The Application Form for Membership on the Community Advisory Council (Application) is used to obtain information about the experience and qualification of persons seeking to be considered for membership on the Board's Community Advisory Council (CAC). The Application collects an applicant's contact information; details regarding current employment and areas of expertise; a resume, which typically includes information about employment history, education, and training; and a cover letter explaining why the applicant is interested in serving on the CAC and their primary qualifications. Applicants can voluntarily elect to provide additional information to support their application.
Proposed revisions: The Board proposes to modify the choices for the organization type, add choices for the areas of expertise on the application, and add two attestations. Organization type would now require a response should an applicant choose "Other" under non-profit or for-profit agencies. Additional subcategories under the government option would include "National," "State," and "Local." The four additional choices for primary and secondary areas of expertise would include "Artificial Intelligence," "Disaster Recovery and Resiliency," "Financial Education," and "Health." The application would have two attestations: (1) affirming there is no applicant relationship to an employee of the Board of Governors, Reserve Bank, or a Board or Reserve Bank advisory council, and (2) that no officer or senior executive of the applicant's current organization has a relationship to an employee of the Board of Governors, Reserve Bank, or a Board or Reserve Bank advisory council. If there is a relationship, applicants would be asked to disclose the name of the employee, director, advisory council member, officer, or senior executive with the relationship to the applicant. Applicants would be asked to indicate the nature of the relationship and whether the employee, director, advisory council member, officer, or senior executive is or was associated with the Board or a Reserve Bank and if at a Reserve Bank, indicate which one. Revisions would be effective as of the 2025 application period.
Frequency: Annual.
Respondents: Individuals seeking to be considered for membership on the CAC.
Total estimated number of respondents: 300.
Total estimated change in burden: 23.
Total estimated annual burden hours: 323.
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 25, 2024.
Benjamin W. McDonough, Deputy Secretary and Ombuds of the Board.
