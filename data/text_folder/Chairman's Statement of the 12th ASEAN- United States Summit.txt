Some countries called on the DPRK to comply fully with all relevant UNSC resolutions and we called for peaceful dialogue among the concerned parties, and continuing working towards the realisation of lasting peace, and stability in a denuclearised Korean Peninsula.

We condemned all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, which have resulted in the alarming number of casualties, particularly women and children, the restricted access to food, water, and other basic needs, leading to the further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We urged all relevant parties to accept the ceasefire proposal as outlined in paragraph 2 of UN Security Council Resolution 2735. We called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, especially 23 ASEAN nationals, women, children, the sick and the elderly. We underscored the importance of release from any arbitrary detention. We commended the efforts of various ASEAN Member States in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and urged all ASEAN Member States and our external partners to continue providing and facilitating such assistance for Gaza. We supported work of United Nations agencies on the ground and the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to discharge her task effectively and efficiently, and to begin the work on post-conflict reconstruction. We called for rapid, safe, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access to all those in need, including through increased capacity at border crossings, including by sea. We called on all parties to the conflict to protect civilians and to abide by international humanitarian law and international human rights law. We urged all parties concerned to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict with a view to realising the two-State solution in accordance with international law and the relevant UNSC and UNGA resolutions, including UNGA resolution A/RES/ES-10/23 on the Admission of New Members to the UN dated 10 May 2024 which we all voted in favour. We took note, and some of us underlined the importance of, the order on provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 26 January 2024. We acknowledged the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ on 19 July 2024, which is of the opinion, among others, that the United Nations, and especially the General Assembly, which requested this opinion, and the Security Council, should consider the precise modalities and further action required to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. We expressed great concern over the escalation of tension in the Middle East and called on all parties concerned to exercise self-restraint, avoid acts that may aggravate the situation, and resolve differences through diplomacy and dialogue in the interest of maintaining peace and stability in the region.
