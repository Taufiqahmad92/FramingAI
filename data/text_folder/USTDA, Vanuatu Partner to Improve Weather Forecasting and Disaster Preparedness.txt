Arlington, VA - The U.S. Trade and Development Agency awarded a technical assistance grant to the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department (VMGD) to support the modernization of weather forecasting and early warning systems in Vanuatu. The project will enhance disaster preparedness and resilience by improving the country's ability to forecast hazardous weather and disseminate effective early warnings to the public. USTDA's assistance will also pilot technology from Massachusetts-based Tomorrow Companies Inc. (Tomorrow.io) to improve the speed and effectiveness of these systems.
"Safeguarding communities from hazardous weather events is of paramount concern to many of our partners across the Pacific Islands," said Enoh T. Ebong, USTDA's Director. "Our partnership with VMGD will advance a priority for Vanuatu, while opening opportunities for U.S. companies to offer highly innovative weather technologies. This project is another example of USTDA's commitment to catalyzing partnerships with the private sector to advance climate resilience and disaster preparedness."
Vanuatu is extremely vulnerable to hazardous weather due to its location in a cyclone-prone region of the South Pacific. Climate change is increasing the severity of cyclones, floods, and droughts, leading to displacement, loss of life, food insecurity, and long-term development challenges.
VMGD has selected Tomorrow.io to deliver the technical assistance, which will conduct a detailed review of existing weather forecasting and early warning services and develop a plan for new investments in weather observation and telecommunication infrastructure. The activity will also pilot Tomorrow.io's weather intelligence platform that leverages the latest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and satellite observation. The project will allow VMGD to equip citizens, farmers, institutions, transportation operators, and businesses with greater quality of information and real-time alerts to better respond and plan for risks associated with increased variability and extreme weather events.
"This partnership with USTDA and Tomorrow.io represents a significant step forward in strengthening Vanuatu's ability to forecast severe weather events and provide timely early warnings to our communities. With our country's vulnerability to cyclones, floods, and other hazards exacerbated by climate change, having access to cutting-edge meteorological technology and services is crucial for protecting lives and livelihoods. We are grateful for the support of the U.S. Government and the innovative solutions offered by Tomorrow.io, which will enhance our forecasting capabilities and help build a more resilient Vanuatu," said Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department Acting Director, Fred Jockley.
U.S. Ambassador to Vanuatu Ann Marie Yastishock said: "Opening the new U.S. Embassy Port Vila in July is a manifestation of our long-term commitment to Vanuatu. Today's ceremony reflects another step forward as we deepen our relationship with the people of Vanuatu. With this assistance, we are working together with the private sector to bring innovative solutions to address the serious impacts of climate change."
"We are honored to support the climate resiliency of the Pacific islands through innovative AI and space-based technologies," said Sebastien Boulay, Advisor to Tomorrow.io and Project Lead. "Aligned with the goals of the Weather Ready Pacific program and backed by U.S. leadership, Tomorrow.io is committed to a long-term partnership with Vanuatu. We deeply value the trust that VMGD and USTDA have placed in this project. With Vanuatu as an early adopter of this groundbreaking technology, we will enhance the existing services provided by VMGD, ensure sustainable funding of a modernized forecasting system, and provide life-saving early warnings to remote communities."
This project supports the U.S. Government's Pacific Islands Infrastructure Initiative and the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE), with the goal of expanding access to cutting-edge climate information, early-warning, and satellite data to bolster climate resilience.
