10.0 EH/s of installed and operational self-mining capacity, doubling year-over-year 
EASTON, Md., Sept. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TeraWulf Inc. (Nasdaq: WULF) (TeraWulf or the Company), a leading owner and operator of vertically integrated, domestic bitcoin mining facilities powered by predominantly zero-carbon energy, today provided an unaudited monthly production and operations update for August 2024.
August 2024Production and Operations Highlights
        
Self-Mined Bitcoin: TeraWulf mined 184 bitcoin in August, achieving an average production rate of approximately 5.9 bitcoin per day.
        
Operating Capacity: The Company's installed and operational self-mining capacity reached approximately 10.0 EH/s, representing a 100.0% increase year-over-year.
        
Power Cost: The average cost per bitcoin mined was $35,407 in August, reflecting an approximate rate of $0.044/kWh. This excludes the benefit from expected demand response and ancillary services proceeds, which are anticipated to be substantial, as outlined below.
        
Demand Response: TeraWulfs Lake Mariner facility curtailed over 1,200 MWh in August as part of its demand response activities. This is expected to reduce power costs by approximately $0.007/kWh for the month, representing a value equivalent of approximately 16 BTC, based on Augusts Value per Bitcoin Self-Mined.

Management Commentary
During August, TeraWulf mined 184 bitcoin, maintaining an average production rate of nearly 6 bitcoin per day, said Sean Farrell, Senior Vice President of Operations at TeraWulf. This underscores our continued operational optimizations, particularly during peak summer temperatures and demand response events, and is evidenced by an improved average operating hash rate compared to July.
Farrell added, "We have made significant progress at the Lake Mariner site on our 2 MW WULF Den proof-of-concept project for WULF Compute, designed to house high-density GPUs. The project remains on track for completion in early September, with chillers and low-voltage transformers installed, and wiring and piping work to deliver power and cooling to the AI room well underway. Additionally, construction of CB-1, our 20 MW AI/HPC building at Lake Mariner, is advancing as planned, with targeted completion by year-end5."
Production and Operations Update
As of August31, 2024, TeraWulf's operational infrastructure capacity included 195 MW at the Lake Mariner facility and 50 MW at the Nautilus facility. The Company's total self-mining hash rate stands at approximately 10.0 EH/s. In August, TeraWulf's miners operated at an average of 8.2 EH/s, influenced by demand response events and performance tuning strategies designed to maximize profitability.
On the WULF Compute front, the Company continues to make steady progress on its large-scale AI/HPC project at the Lake Mariner facility. This includes ongoing construction of a 2 MW AI/HPC digital infrastructure proof-of-concept building, designed to support both current and next-generation GPU technology. Additionally, TeraWulf is developing a 20 MW colocation pilot project, CB-1, at Lake Mariner. This building is engineered to support 16 MW of critical IT load with liquid cooling and redundancy features typical of a Tier 3 data center, and it remains on track to be operational by year-end.
About TeraWulf
TeraWulf owns and operates vertically integrated, environmentally clean data center infrastructure in the United States, which is currently deployed to mine bitcoin sustainably. Led by an experienced group of energy entrepreneurs, the Company currently has two facilities: the wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York, and Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. Today, TeraWulf generates domestically produced bitcoin powered by predominantly zero carbon energy resources, including nuclear and hydro, with a long-term goal of utilizing 100% zero-carbon energy. With a core focus on ESG that ties directly to its business success, TeraWulf aims to provide industry leading mining and data center economics at an industrial scale.

1 The Companys share of the earnings or losses from operations at the Nautilus Cryptomine facility is reflected within Equity in net income (loss) of investee, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, operating results of the Nautilus Cryptomine facility are not reflected in revenue, cost of revenue or cost of operations lines in TeraWulfs consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses these metrics as indicators of operational progress and effectiveness and believes they are useful to investors for the same purposes and to provide comparisons to peer companies. All figures except Bitcoin Self-Mined are estimates and remain subject to standard month-end adjustments. 2 Computed as the weighted-average opening price of bitcoin on each respective day the Bitcoin Self-Mined is earned.3 While nameplate mining inventory as of August31, 2024 for WULFs two facilities is estimated at 10.0 EH/s, actual monthly hash rate performance depends on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) performance tuning to increase efficiency and maximize margin, scheduled outages (scopes to improve reliability or performance), unscheduled outages, curtailment due to participation in various cash generating demand response programs, derate of ASICS due to adverse weather and ASIC maintenance and repair.4 Nameplate miner efficiency excludes auxiliary load.5 The 2 MW AI/HPC digital infrastructure within the WULF Den pilot project and the 16 MW AI/HPC building at the Lake Mariner facility are IT Load (compute).
