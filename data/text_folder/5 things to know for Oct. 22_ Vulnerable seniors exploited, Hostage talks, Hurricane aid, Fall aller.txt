Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Vulnerable seniors exploited
Deceptive tactics have misled hundreds of elderly Americans - many battling dementia or other cognitive impairments - into giving away millions of dollars to political fundraising campaigns, a CNN investigation has revealed. The desperate pleas for donations frequently come as text messages and emails delivered at an unrelenting pace, directing these vulnerable individuals to pages that often sign them up for monthly - or even weekly - donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it. Contributions from a small sampling of 50 unwitting elderly donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years - the majority of which ended up with former President Donald Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found.
2. Hostage talks
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East as the US seeks to move forward with long-stalled negotiations to bring back the Israeli hostages and end the war in Gaza. In the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, there appears to be little clarity on who will take over the militant group, making it difficult to ascertain the probability of striking a new deal. Hamas has shown no inclination to change its stance on hostage and ceasefire negotiations. Blinken is expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today amid tempered expectations he will return to Washington having made any significant progress on the hostage talks. Instead, US officials believe that the most pivotal place for him to make progress is on the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza.
3. Hurricane aid
Former President Donald Trump repeated debunked claims about the federal response to Hurricane Helene during his visit to North Carolina on Monday. Speaking to reporters in a hard-hit community near Asheville, Trump made the false assertion that FEMA took money that was supposed to go to disaster relief and instead spent it on migrants who entered the country illegally, leaving the agency with no funds to help Americans. Trump claimed that FEMA's money is "all gone" - which is false. As of last Tuesday, its Disaster Relief Fund had about $8.5 billion remaining, FEMA told CNN. The agency has made clear that it has enough money for the immediate needs of people affected by Hurricane Helene - though the large number of disasters around the country this year means the agency might have to ask Congress for additional disaster relief funding sooner than expected.
4. Fall allergies
Allergy season is starting earlier and lasting longer, which scientists attribute to a variety of causes, including the climate crisis. As temperatures stay warmer into the fall, plants that release allergens have more time to grow. What's more, higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel use and emissions further drive plant growth, generating more pollen. The most common culprit for fall allergies is a plant called ragweed, the CDC says, which can release 1 billion grains of pollen per plant. Pollen exposure can trigger various allergic reactions, including symptoms of hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis. These symptoms vary seasonally or year-round, affecting up to 60 million people annually in the US, according to the CDC.

5. Waffle recall
Dozens of frozen waffle products, including waffles sold under Walmart and Target store labels, have been voluntarily recalled due to potential listeria contamination. The products made by TreeHouse Foods were distributed throughout the US and Canada. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled waffles. However, the company has urged consumers to check their freezers and discard the contaminated products or return them to the store the product was purchased from for credit. This recall follows a recent string of listeria outbreaks, including a late-July recall issued for more than 7.2 million pounds of Boar's Head deli meats. The ready-to-eat meat and poultry items producer BrucePac also recently recalled more than 11.7 million pounds of products due to possible listeria contamination.
