Hello Laura,
This past week has been a busy one both in Washington, D.C. and Wyoming, as I spent time
attending events, touring businesses, meeting with constituents, and visiting with the U.S. Forest
Service (USFS) to learn more about their immediate, short-term, and long-term response to the Elk
Fire in the Big Horn Mountains in northern Wyoming.
Although the House of Representatives is not in session in D.C. right now, I am continuing to focus
on my legislative priorities as we finish out the 118th Congress. Just in the last few days I introduced
two new pieces of legislation, signed an amicus brief opposing proxy voting (challenging the legality
of Pelosis 2022 omnibus spending bill for lack of a quorum), and joined a letter calling out the
Biden-Harris administration's continued support of housing illegal aliens on federal lands.
Keep reading below to learn more about these important issues!
Elk Fire Update and Resources
Many of you have recently reached out to my office regarding the wildfires raging through northern
Wyoming and burning hundreds of thousands of acres in our state. My staff and I have been staying
closely engaged in relation to these challenging conditions and catastrophes, most recently in
response to the Elk Fire that has so far burned 92,487 acres of land while being only 28%
contained.
On Monday, I spent time with several officials from the Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident
Management Team, first in receiving a briefing as to the on-the-ground situation then spending
several hours touring the fire-impacted area and surrounding lands. I have also had the opportunity
to visit with local landowners, stakeholders, forest permittees, and community leaders to stay
abreast of conditions and to try to develop a plan for addressing their concerns.
While on site, I met with numerous firefighters; specialty teams (helicopter and fire behavior
experts); leaders of the ground operations; and those developing the strategy for extinguishing the
fire while also protecting high value assets such as homes, outbuildings, pastures, and Sheridans
water supply. I was heartened to learn that some of the most highly qualified teams in the region are
handling the fire, and many of the team members live right here in Wyoming. With a fire crew of
nearly 1,000 personnel and 13 aircraft, multiple crews, scores of engines, heavy equipment, and a
variety of other types of machinery, I am confident and was assured that the Incident Management
Team has the resources they need to fight the fire.
Efforts by firefighting crews to contain and slow the fires progress include securing boundary lines
such as the 7-mile-long control line from Big Goose Creek to Red Grade Road and clearing
flammable debris. Strategic fire operations north of Burgess Junction, aerial water drops, and
continued patrols have also assisted in reducing potential fire movement and intensity. For the latest
updates on the Elk Fire, click here.
I greatly appreciate everyone in the state who have spent so much of their time and energy this
year fighting fires, providing support, feeding our firefighters and first responders, hauling
equipment, and protecting homes and businesses. This has been the worst fire season in
Wyoming of my lifetime, with so many family members, friends, and fellow Wyomingites affected.
I hope the forecasted moisture will finally put an end to the destruction, allow us to regroup, and
provide a much-needed breather to assess the short- and long-term situation.
My Bill Would Fast-Track Resolutions for DOI Disputes
On Friday, I introduced the Expedited Appeals Review Act, the purpose of which is to address a
longstanding problem within the Department of the Interior (DOI) and appeals to the Interior Board
of Land Appeals (IBLA). Under the current rules and protocols, it is common for parties to wait years
before the IBLA hears their appeal and issues a decision, with over 90% of such cases being
resolved in the governments favor (something to be expected considering the IBLA is essentially
the DOIs own court system).
My bill is designed to fix this process by providing an optional off-ramp that allows appellants to opt
for an expedited ruling that could reach a federal district court in as little as eighteen months. This
would permit certain parties to fast-track access to a neutral arbiter while allowing those parties who
wish to stay before the IBLA that opportunity as well.
This bill is a win for anyone who must deal with the DOI in relation to land use issues and moves us
closer to complying with the constitutional mandate of separation of powers, as it chips away at the
judicial authority claimed by the executive agencies, whose system currently allows a variety of
federal agencies to write, enforce, and judicially review the law.
Working to Create a National Human Trafficking Database
According to statistics from the U.S. Department of State, there are an estimated 27.6 million
human trafficking victims worldwide at any given time, a problem worsened in America by the BidenHarris administration's reckless open border policies. When I visited the Eagle Pass sector of the
Texas border in January of this year, I learned that the cartels were making $35 million per week
trafficking men, women, and children into the United States. Unfortunately, human trafficking is
among the worlds fastest-growing criminal enterprises and is estimated to be a $150 billion-a-year
global industry.
Despite these alarming facts, the U.S. does not compile comprehensive data related to human
trafficking within our borders. It is almost as though there are people within our government who do
not want to know what is happening. To combat this, I joined Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) in introducing
the National Human Trafficking Database Act, which would establish a national human trafficking
database at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and incentivize state law enforcement agencies to
report data.
This bill would also direct the DOJ's Office for Victims of Crime to award $50 million per fiscal year
in grant funding for states and tribes to collect and submit data. This would include awarding grants
to and collecting data from the Missing and Murdered Unit of the Office of Justice Services of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is especially important to me as Chair of the Subcommittee on Indian
and Insular Affairs and the representative for the Wind River Reservation.
I am proud to support this legislation, as human trafficking is a scourge on our society. No one
should be subjected to this type of treatment, and gathering the data to better understand the
situation is a step in the right direction.
Taking Steps to End Proxy Voting
On Wednesday, I joined Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) and nine other House Republican colleagues in filing
an amicus brief to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas v. DOJ, a case challenging the passage
of the FY23 omnibus because of its use of proxy voting. The Quorum Clause of the Constitution
requires that a quorum, defined as a majority of the House, be physically present on the floor when
the House transacts business.
However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi authorized
proxy voting, which allowed members of Congress to vote despite not even being in Washington,
D.C. One of the worst bills that was passed with a majority of members participating by proxy was
the December 2022 omnibus spending billa $1.7 trillion boondoggle filled with out-of-control
spending and bad policy.
Our amicus brief was filed partially in response to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's recent
amicus brief in which he defended proxy voting and argued that courts should stay out of
congressional procedure, despite his having opposed the practice on the Senate floor in 2020. The
district court previously ruled in favor of Texas (an action in which Rep. Roy and I also filed an
amicus brief), with the DOJ having since appealed that ruling.
My hope is that the 5th Circuit upholds the lower court's decision, as no oneincluding Congress
should be held above the law. More importantly, no oneESPECIALLY Congressshould be
allowed to violate the Constitution. To learn more and to read the brief, click here.

Recent Votes
The House was out of session this week. For my full voting record, click here.
Cosponsored Legislation
1. H.R.9859, the Abundant American Resources Act of 2024, which would require federal land
management agencies to conduct a study on the economic valuation of resources in areas
that have been withdrawn or protected from exploration and production.
2. H.R.9913, the Ending FCC Meddling in Our Elections Act, which would prohibit the use of
federal funds to enforce the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) notice of
proposed rulemaking related to the use of artificial intelligence in campaign advertising.
Cosigned Letters
1. On Wednesday, I joined the House Natural Resources Committee in sending a letter to New
York Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams questioning their decision, in conjunction
with the Biden-Harris administration, to continue housing illegal aliens on National Park
Service land despite heavy opposition from New York City residents.
Tweet of the Week
Video of the Week
I recently joined the Oklahoma Stockgrowers Association to discuss the USDA's electronic
identification (EID) eartag mandate for cattle and bison and the Biden-Harris 30x30 land grab. As
your lone representative, I will continue to fight back against the mandatory EID rule that will
unfairly burden ranchers and do everything in my power to stop the 30x30 efforts.
In the News
Forbes Breaking News featured a Natural
Resources Committee hearing during which I
discussed my bill, H.R.6085, which would block
the implementation of the Bureau of Land
Management's Rock Springs Resource
Management Plan.
The Washington Examiner highlighted
my questioning of Council of the Inspectors
General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)
Chairman Mark Greenblatt regarding
politicization within CIGIE and its targeting of
Department of Homeland Security Inspector
General Joseph Cuffari, who has sought to
expose the Biden-Harris administration's
mishandling of the border crisis.
Forbes also featured my participation in a
Judiciary Committee hearing before the
October district work period, during which I
discussed the need for Congress to take
action to ensure illegal aliens are not voting in
our elections.
I spoke with Cowboy State Daily on
Wednesday to discuss a lack of forest
management and bad policies coming out of
Washington, D.C. which have contributed to
the wildfires that have burned 600,000 acres
in our state this season. While I commend the
Forest Service employees who have been
working diligently to fight these fires in
Wyoming, it is imperative that we revisit those
rules and regulations that have created this
situation in the first place.
The Roadless Rule, put in place in the waning
days of the Clinton administration, was not
only one of the largest rulemakings in U.S.
history but also one of the most destructive,
with the beetle outbreak and catastrophic
forest fires being directly caused by that rule.
I encourage you to click the above article to
