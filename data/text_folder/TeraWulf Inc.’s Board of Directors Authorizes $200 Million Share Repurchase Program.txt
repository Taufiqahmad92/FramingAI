The share repurchase program reflects the Companys confidence in its business strategy and financial health. TeraWulf intends to repurchase shares using excess cash, prioritizing this initiative after disciplined capital expenditures aimed at supporting organic growth in HPC/AI and evaluating strategic opportunities, such as potential site acquisitions.
We have taken decisive steps to strengthen our balance sheet, including fully retiring our debt earlier this year, while making substantial progress in executing our business strategy, said Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer of TeraWulf. These achievements reinforce our confidence in TeraWulfs long-term vision. With a stronger financial foundation, we are well-positioned to optimize our capital allocation. The Boards approval of a $200 million share repurchase program over the next year highlights our commitment to creating value for stockholders and driving profitable growth, all while delivering strong returns.
When determining the amount of capital to be allocated to share repurchases, TeraWulf will consider various factors, including historical and projected business performance, cash flow, liquidity, and prevailing global economic and market conditions. The Company will also assess the market price of its common stock.
The timing, method, price, and volume of any share repurchases will be at the Companys discretion. Purchases may be made through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or through investment banking structures, among other avenues, subject to applicable laws. The Company is not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares and retains the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the program at any time.
