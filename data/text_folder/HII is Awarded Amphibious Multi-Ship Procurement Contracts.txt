"We greatly appreciate the stability that this award provides to all Ingalls shipbuilders and our surrounding communities, Ingalls President Kari Wilkinson said. It is an honor to continue our support of the joint Navy and Marine Corps mission to meet the minimum 31-amphibious-ship requirement.
Approximately half of all Ingalls shipbuilders build amphibious ships today, with another 650 supplier partners in 39 states across the country that provide components for the construction of amphibious ships.
We stand ready to reinforce an already strong team of capable shipbuilders with the ideas and skills of new shipbuilders that want to make a difference in the world, Wilkinson said. There is no greater sense of accomplishment than doing something difficult in support of our nations military.
