The Gold Coast in 2074: Brighter, Denser and Digital
By Bhishna Bajracharya
How many of you remember the Gold Coast as it was 50 years ago?
Now cast your thoughts forward. What will the Gold Coast be like in 2074?
Insights from the once-in-a-decade CSIRO Megatrends Report and the South East Queensland Regional Plan offer clues to the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Drawing on these and my experience as an associate professor of urban planning at Bond University, here are six megatrends I believe will shape the Gold Coast City as it approaches the turn of the century.
1. Development of the mega-urban region
We like to see ourselves as a city distinct from Brisbane, but development driven by rapid population growth means the Gold Coast is becoming part of a 200km-long Gold Coast-Brisbane-Sunshine Coast mega-urban region.
To thrive, the Coast will need faster trains connecting with Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast in the north, and the Tweed region and Coffs Harbour to the south.
Planners must focus on transit-oriented developments such as higher-density housing around transit nodes with amenities for living, working and recreation.
The Gold Coast Airport will become increasingly important, supporting business, tourism and education travellers, as well as exporting freight from the Gold Coast Hinterland.
2. Digital revolution and the rise of AI
The digital revolution is reshaping economies and societies globally, and the Gold Coast must embrace this transformation to stay competitive.
To attract technology companies, the city should establish innovation hubs linked to universities, and co-working spaces for start-up businesses.
Providing skill-upgrading opportunities that promote the productive use of AI and other technologies in local businesses - such as tourism, health and education - will be crucial.
Forty per cent of Australians now work remotely on a regular basis and the future demand for digital workers is expected to increase by 79 per cent from 2020 to 2025.
3. Climate change and natural hazards
We saw the power of nature during the 1974 floods, and with climate change, the next catastrophic event is not a matter of if, but when.
The city must plan new developments away from natural hazards, including bushfire-prone and flood-prone areas.
These new developments should move away from vulnerable coastal areas - these may require the construction of sea walls - with adequate buffers to deal with the long-term impacts of sea level rise.
Infrastructure, including hospitals, aged care homes and emergency services, should be climate-proofed, while planning and building codes must be continuously reviewed and upgraded for climate resilience.
4. Demands to protect quality of life
The city's unique lifestyle with a subtropical climate, some of the world's best beaches and fringing national parks have driven its rapid growth since the 1970s.
The challenge now lies in balancing this growth with the need to preserve these natural assets and maintain a high quality of life for residents.
The city should focus strongly on health, education, sustainability and inclusivity to attract new businesses and a skilled workforce.
Universities can play a vital role here. Improving health outcomes for the city's diverse population, including the growing retiree demographic, will be key.
The city needs to integrate "universal design principles" in its buildings and infrastructure so people with diverse abilities can conveniently use them.
The city must promote active and healthy transport by enhancing walking and cycling amenities.
5. Diversification of the economy
Economic diversification is necessary to reduce dependence on tourism and construction, and expand sectors such as health, education and technology.
New initiatives should foster greater cross-border economic collaboration between the Gold Coast and Tweed for regional development.
Joint planning and co-ordination with councils such as Brisbane, Logan and Tweed is essential.
Major international events, such as the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, can promote health and fitness facilities on the Gold Coast, support training and events, and create and maintain legacy infrastructure.
6. The need for affordable housing
Affordable housing is a hot issue in 2024 and that is unlikely to change as the Gold Coast's population surges through the one million mark.
To increase the supply of affordable housing, the city should provide incentives to developers and community housing providers, such as tax breaks, cheaper land, grants, planning relaxations, and support for mixed-use and high-density housing.
A minimum percentage of affordable housing should be required in large masterplanned communities and high-density developments.
Policies must be developed to ensure short-term rental platforms like Airbnb do not negatively impact the availability of long-term affordable housing.
By effectively navigating these megatrends, the Gold Coast can continue to harness the unique natural strengths that have seen it evolve from a collection of seaside villages into a vibrant, global city.
