UBAR(TM) will be the first place in the world that offers a real-world cyberpunk lifestyle - featuring the next generation of gaming, IRL Gaming - in the world's first city built for play, Qiddiya City in Saudi Arabia. UBAR's lore is a cybertropolis set in Arab Futurism and gamified as an RPG (role playing game).
"In UBAR(TM) cyberpunk-themed apartments are designed for gamers, jobs redefine the future of gaming, achievements unlock access to elite lounges, and nightlife pulsates-in a city that can be played through IRL-bringing it all together. Finally, UBAR(TM) is a place for the cyberpunk community to truly belong," said Arnab Bhattacharya, Director of Strategy for Qiddiya Gaming.
At Tokyo Game Show, watch the world premiere of UBAR(TM) the game trailer from BAFTA(TM) and MTV VMA award-winning Creative Director and Artist, YKBX. https://ykbx.jp/
Attendees at TGS will co-create with Qiddiya Gaming in UBAR(TM) by hacking into the system, earning cheat codes to crack the Sentinel(TM) developed by Creature Technology Company, brand their persona with a digital UBAR(TM) ID, collect swag inspired by YKBX, and earn achievements to win the first relic in this zone, a replica, high-value Sentinel.
Additionally, special appearances and daily stage programming from Crazy Raccoon, ZETA DIVISION and notable VTubers will be livestreamed on @qiddiyagaming Twitch. Fans can Meet & Greet the game's characters Layla & Noriko, score an autographed poster with original art by Hugh Fleming, and download the Music of UBAR remixed by DJ Makoto on Spotify or where you stream your music.

The Lore of UBAR(TM) (video)
Before UBAR was ripped from its universe and transported to Qiddiya, it stood as the pinnacle of human achievement and the perfect fusion of creativity and technology.
In its original universe, UBAR, known here as the "Atlantis of the Sands," was never lost to time but evolved into a futuristic metropolis, blending global cultures and innovations. As the world outside succumbed to climate disaster, UBAR opened its doors to the climate refugees, becoming a dynamic hub of multiculturalism and technological marvels driven by super-intelligent, organic computing, creating a new kind of cyberpunk where humans and machine merged into something new. This movement was dubbed, Arab Futurism.
Behind the fa√ßade of this technological utopia, a rot is slowly setting in; an emerging entity is corrupting the AI caretakers of UBAR with only one agenda. Rid UBAR of the humans that built it. Forever.
UBAR(TM) powered by Qiddiya Gaming is open at Tokyo Game Show, September 26-29, 2024 at Makuhari Messe, Hall 4 from 10am-5pm, daily (and on the 29th September from 9:30am-4:30pm).
