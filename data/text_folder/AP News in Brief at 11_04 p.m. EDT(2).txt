JERUSALEM  Israeli ground forces crossed into southern Lebanon early Tuesday, marking a significant escalation of an offensive against Hezbollah militants and opening a new front in a yearlong war against its Iranian-backed adversaries.
The incursion follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against Hezbollah  including an airstrike that killed its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah  and seeks to step up the pressure on the group, which began firing rockets into northern Israel after the start of the war in Gaza. The last time Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ground combat was a monthlong war in 2006.
The Israeli military said in a brief statement it had begun limited, localized and targeted ground raids against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.
These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel, it said.
There was no word on how long the operation would last, but the army said soldiers had been training and preparing for the mission in recent months. Israel has said it will continue to strike the group until it is safe for displaced Israelis from border communities to return to their homes.

Supplies arrive by plane and by mule in North Carolina as Helene's death toll tops 130
ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP)  Widespread devastation left behind by Hurricane Helene came to light Monday across the South, revealing a wasteland of splintered houses, crushed cargo containers and mud-covered highways in one of the worst storms in U.S. history. The death toll topped 130.
A crisis was unfolding in western North Carolina, where residents stranded by washed-out roads and by a lack of power and cellular service lined up for fresh water and a chance to message loved ones days after the storm that they were alive.
At least 133 deaths in six Southeastern states have been attributed to the storm that inflicted damage from Florida's Gulf Coast to the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia.
The toll steadily rose as emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding. During a briefing Monday, White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall suggested as many as 600 people hadnt been accounted for as of Monday afternoon, saying some might be dead.
President Joe Biden said he will travel to North Carolina on Wednesday to meet with officials and take an aerial tour of Asheville.

Leaders depart UN facing prospect of a wider Mideast war  but with a blueprint for a better future
UNITED NATIONS (AP)  They gathered at the United Nations surrounded by unsettling warnings of an escalating conflict that could engulf the Middle East and further shatter international relations that are based on "multilateralism"  nations working together and sharing power. A week later, world leaders headed home with the prospect of a broader war intensifying and global divisions front and center, not only in the Mideast but elsewhere.
There was no expectation of major breakthroughs in the public and private meetings at the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of presidents, premiers and other leaders. There rarely is. But this year was especially grim, with no end in sight to the three major conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and Israeli military action in Lebanon escalating.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning that multilateralism needs to be brought back from the brink added to the gloom, along with speech after speech decrying failures to tackle climate change and address growing inequalities between rich and poor nations, and warning of artificial intelligence with no guardrails and the potential of killer weapons with no human control.
General Assembly President Phil√©mon Yang concluded the weeklong, high-level meeting Monday afternoon, calling it particularly tumultuous and pointing to the violent conflicts that are raging.
This is, unfortunately, not an exhaustive list of the crises and conflicts affecting member states of the United Nations, he lamented.

With strike looming, progress is reported in talks between Eastern and Gulf ports and dockworkers
NEW YORK (AP)  With a strike deadline looming, the union for 45,000 dockworkers and the group representing East and Gulf Coast ports have exchanged wage offers, leaving a ray of hope that a deal can be reached without a major work stoppage.
In a statement, the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents 36 ports from Maine to Texas, said that both sides have moved from their previous positions. The alliance said it also asked the union to extend the current contract.
The International Longshoremens Association is threatening to strike at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday in a move that could silence ports that handle about half the ship cargo coming in and going out of the U.S.
A message was left Monday evening seeking comment from the union.
We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement, the alliance statement said.

Pete Rose, baseballs banned hits leader, has died at age 83
NEW YORK (AP)  Pete Rose, baseballs career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83.
Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Wheatley said his cause and manner of death had not yet been determined. Over the weekend, he had appeared at an autograph show in Nashville with former teammates Tony Perez, George Foster and Dave Concepcion.
For fans who came of age in the 1960s and 70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds No. 14, Charlie Hustle, the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious, dirt-stained throwback to baseballs early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag.
Major League Baseball, which banished him in 1989, issued a brief statement expressing condolences and noting his greatness, grit and determination on the field of play. Reds principal owner and managing partner Bob Castellini said in a statement that Rose was one of the fiercest competitors the game has ever seen and added: "We must never forget what he accomplished.
A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseballs most formidable lineups with the Reds championship teams of 1975 and 1976, featuring Hall of Famers Perez, Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan.

Judge strikes down Georgia ban on abortions, allowing them to resume beyond 6 weeks into pregnancy
ATLANTA (AP)  A Georgia judge on Monday struck down the state's abortion law, which took effect in 2022 and effectively prohibited abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that the law violates Georgia's Constitution, finding that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Thirteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where bans begin after about the first six weeks of pregnancy  often before women realize theyre pregnant.
McBurney's ruling would allow abortions through at least 20 weeks of pregnancy.
Kara Murray, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said he would immediately appeal to the state supreme court. The state high court earlier reversed a separate ruling by McBurney that had struck down the law on different grounds and could put Monday's ruling on hold pending an appeal.

Trump makes false claims about federal response as he campaigns in area ravaged by Hurricane Helene
VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP)  Donald Trump repeatedly spread falsehoods Monday about the federal response to Hurricane Helene despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster as he toured hard-hit areas in south Georgia.
The former president and Republican nominee claimed upon landing in Valdosta that President Joe Biden was sleeping and not responding to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who he said was calling the president and hasnt been able to get him. He repeated the claim at an event with reporters after being told Kemp said he had spoken to Biden.
Hes lying, and the governor told him he was lying, Biden said Monday.
The White House previously announced that Biden spoke by phone Sunday night with Kemp and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, as well as Scott Matheson, mayor of Valdosta, Georgia, and Florida Emergency Management Director John Louk. Kemp confirmed Monday morning that he spoke to Biden the night before.
The president just called me yesterday afternoon and I missed him and called him right back and he just said Hey, what do you need? And I told him, you know, weve got what we need, well work through the federal process, Kemp said. He offered if there are other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that."

China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger
BEIJING (AP)  China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state.
No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy.
Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a Century of Humiliation.
In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries.
The worlds second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden administration doubles down on tough asylum restrictions at border
WASHINGTON (AP)  The Biden administration said Monday it is making asylum restrictions at the southern border even tougher, as it's increasingly eager to show voters uneasy over immigration that it is taking a hard stance on border security.
The new rules, which toughen restrictions announced in June, bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed.
Under the previous rules, the U.S. could restrict asylum access when the number of migrants trying to enter the country between the official border crossings hit 2,500 per day. The daily numbers had to average below 1,500 per day for a week in order for the restrictions to be lifted.
The version rolled out Monday says the daily numbers will have to be below 1,500 for nearly a month before the restrictions can be lifted. And the administration is now counting all children toward that number, whereas previously only migrant children from Mexico were counted.
These changes, which go into effect on Tuesday, will make it much more difficult to lift the restrictions and allow people entering the country between the official border crossings eventually to apply for asylum in the U.S.

Justice Department will launch civil rights review into 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  The Justice Department announced Monday it plans to launch a review of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, an attack by a white mob on a thriving Black district that is considered one of the worst single acts of violence against Black people in U.S. history.
The review was launched under a federal cold-case initiative that has led to prosecutions of some Civil Rights Era cases, although Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke said they have no expectation there is anyone living who could be prosecuted as a result of the inquiry. Still, the announcement of a first-ever federal probe into the massacre was embraced by descendants of survivors who have long criticized city and state leaders for not doing more to compensate those affected by the attack.
Clarke said the agency plans to issue a public report detailing its findings by the end of the year.
We acknowledge descendants of the survivors, and the victims continue to bear the trauma of this act of racial terrorism, Clarke said during her remarks in Washington.
Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the last known survivors of the massacre, 110-year-old Viola Fletcher and 109-year-old Lessie Benningfield Randle, described Clarke's announcement as a joyous occasion.
