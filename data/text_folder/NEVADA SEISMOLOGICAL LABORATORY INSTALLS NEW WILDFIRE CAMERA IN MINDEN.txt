A new wildfire camera was installed in Minden, Nevada on Oct. 16, to help NV Energy and local agencies detect new wildfire starts. This advanced warning system enables firefighters to respond more quickly and accurately to any new fires and provide ongoing situational awareness during fire response.
The camera installation is a partnership between the Nevada Seismological Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Nevada, Reno, NV Energy's natural disaster protection program, also called PowerSafe NV, Douglas County and AT&T. The camera is mounted on a pre-existing AT&T cell tower, providing strategic placement for optimal coverage.
"Collaborations like this between local governments, the University, and partners like NV Energy are critical for maintaining and expanding Nevada's fire camera network," NSL Director Christie Rowe said. "The Minden camera will add coverage of Sierras and Pine Nut Mountains, enabling faster fire detection and response for Minden and surrounding communities."
NV Energy and the University of Nevada, Reno have a longstanding partnership that has fostered innovative projects benefiting Northern Nevada.
"Accurate, up-to-date information is crucial for first responders and NV Energy as we continue to adapt to changing climate conditions," Jesse Murray, NV Energy's vice president of electric delivery and natural disaster protection, said."We're working with our partners to ensure we install and maintain cameras in strategic locations to keep our communities and our electric infrastructure safe."
NV Energy sponsors 20 wildfire cameras across the state as part of the PowerSafe NV program. The camera streams are fed to servers where artificial intelligence software detects new fire starts and sends an automatic notification to first responders and other agencies.
"Douglas County is thankful to the generous support of NV Energy and the NSL team at the University of Nevada, Reno for providing the replacement camera which is attached to the ALERTWest system,"said Brent Finster, Emergency Communications Manager for Douglas County."The existing camera has been used by Emergency Communications Center personnel for wildland fire and law enforcement purposes for almost ten years. When it was time to replace that camera, we reached out to University of Nevada, Reno and NV Energy to discuss making the camera accessible to both 9-1-1 dispatch staff and the wildland fire community. The cooperation has been outstanding."
These cameras are part of a cooperative network across Nevada and neighboring states. The live camera streams are accessible to fire agencies, utilities, public lands, foresters, dispatchers, researchers and the public. The live streams from the cameras can be viewed online.
