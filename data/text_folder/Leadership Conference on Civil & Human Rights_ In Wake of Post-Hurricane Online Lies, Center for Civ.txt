Review of false social media posts after Hurricanes Helene and Milton offers clear call to action on election disinformation
Tips for voters here [View Tip in the link at bottom.] on what to look for to spot dis- and misinformation
* * *
A review of social media posts stemming from Hurricanes Helene and Milton makes clear that social media platforms have failed to address digital voting disinformation and must do so now in the run-up to the election and on Election Day itself, according to The Leadership Conference's Center for Civil Rights and Technology (the Center). Social media platforms continue to be rife with misinformation, disinformation, and fake AI images presented as news. These posts, in turn, have been supercharged by large accounts with big followings and, unfortunately, appear to be connected to threats of violence against FEMA workers in North Carolina.
With early and mail-in voting already underway in many states, and with Election Day approaching, the Center is both sounding the alarm and once again calling on social media companies to establish and enforce civic and elections policies, address AI-generated and manipulated media, resource election teams to protect against voting disinformation, limit rampant resharing of voting disinformation (i.e., rate limits, removing share buttons), and amplify authoritative and truthful information about voting and elections. The Center and civil society groups have repeatedly called for social media platforms to address digital disinformation.
Koustubh "K.J." Bagchi, vice president of the Center for Civil Rights and Technology, said: "The amount of false information that spread online during the hurricanes was staggering -- but not unsurprising. Unfortunately, platforms are no longer enforcing the barebones guidelines around content moderation they themselves imposed and, in fact, gutting their trust and safety teams. While there is still time for platforms to put up some guardrails, like limiting the rampant resharing of disinformation and amplifying authoritative information, there are also steps that voters can take to protect themselves from these lies."
Maya Wiley, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said: "Free and fair elections require trust and safety -- trust in the information we receive and safety online. We knew what would come in this election cycle. We documented the increase in hate crimes during election cycles and we advocated with social media platforms to strengthen their content moderation and their policies to ensure free and fair elections. They declined. Now, in the wake of horrific hurricanes that have already tested our emergency response and elections administration, we disturbingly see what is sadly predictable. There is still time for social media companies to step up and do what is right. All people deserve to understand where and how to get help, where and how to vote, and to know what has been doctored or distorted when it comes to both. Social media companies should be vigilant on verifiably dangerous disinformation online. We have the power and ability to balance free speech rights with verification, links, labeling, and ensuring algorithms demote rather than promote dangerous disinformation. And we will continue to press Congress to act to make sure they enact safeguards."

THE CENTER FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND TECHNOLOGY ANTICIPATES THE FOLLOWING COULD HAPPEN BEFORE, ON, AND FOLLOWING ELECTION DAY:
* Disinformation about polling locations, access to voting, and people's ability to vote
* False information about the security of ballots, dropboxes, and vote-by-mail
* False information that ineligible voters are registering and voting in federal elections
* Online harassment of election officials
* Preemptive and false accusations of voter fraud
* Manipulated media
* False information about voting procedures and certification of ballots
* Claims of false or incorrect results
* AI-generated images and misleading videos designed to outrage or cast doubts on the process
* Discrediting legitimate information and news sources
* Accounts with big followings amplifying false stories
* Bot or troll farms pumping lies into the ecosystem
* * *
SAMPLE POST-HURRICANE DISINFORMATION:
TRUE: According to Blue Ridge Public Radio, there are no lithium deposits in Western North Carolina, where Chimney Rock, NC is located.
Rutherford County Emergency Management said in a press release that claims of government seizure of Chimney Rock are entirely false. They've also shared that there was no "special meeting" to discuss seizing the town. The meeting was for elected and government officials "to hear directly the impact to their individual municipalities and to request their support and advocacy for federal and state support."
FALSE: Multiple false claims that authorities are attempting to seize Chimney Rock, NC in order to control a lithium mine have spread across various social media platforms.
* * *
TRUE: As Dr. Kristen Corbosiero, a meteorologist and professor at University of Albany, told Scripps News, "Meteorologists do not control the weather." Scientists have completely denounced weather control conspiracy theories.
FALSE: There were false claims online that the government controlled the weather to make the weather hit Republican areas.
* * *
TRUE: FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is dedicated to response and recovery efforts for domestic major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm state resources. The DRF supports responses, including:
* Emergency protection and debris removal
* The repair and restoration of qualifying disaster-damaged public infrastructure
* Hazard mitigation initiatives
* Financial assistance to eligible disaster survivors
* Fire Management Assistance Grants for qualifying large forest or grassland wildfires
According to FEMA, its "Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts." In fact, "No money is being diverted from disaster response needs."
FALSE: A widely circulated claim is asserting that FEMA has run out of money because disaster relief funds are supporting undocumented immigrants. This line of disinformation is tied to dangerous anti-immigrant rhetoric being spread this election season.
