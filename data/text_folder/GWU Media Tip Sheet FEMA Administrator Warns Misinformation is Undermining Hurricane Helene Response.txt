FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell voiced concerns about the impact of rampant misinformation surrounding Hurricane Helene, stating that false claims are discouraging survivors from seeking help and damaging responder morale.
She attributed much of the misinformation to conspiracy theories fueled by GOP figures, including Donald Trump and Elon Musk, while urging the public to rely on official channels for disaster information.
Faculty experts at the George Washington University are available to offer insight, analysis and commentary on the harmful impacts of disinformation and can help debunk FEMA misinformation.
