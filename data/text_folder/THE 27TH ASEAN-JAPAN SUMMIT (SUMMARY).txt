On October 10, commencing at 11:40 a.m. local time (1:40 pm, JST) for approximately 60 minutes, the 27th ASEAN-Japan Summit was held in in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Mr. ISHIBA Shigeru, Prime Minister of Japan, attended the meeting. The overview of the meeting is as follows.
1. ASEAN-Japan cooperation
(1) Following the remarks by Lao Prime Minister Sonexay, the Chair of the meeting, Prime Minister Ishiba delivered his remarks outlined as follows:
i. I am honored to participate in the meeting with the ASEAN leaders, who are true friends of Japan with "heart to heart" connections, on my first overseas visit since assuming the post of Prime Minister. Japan and ASEAN have built a relationship of trust over half a century. At the outset, I wish to convey our strong determination to further strengthen this relationship.
ii. Japan wishes to shape and safeguard the future together with ASEAN, which shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and is a growth center of the world.
iii. We will also strongly support the theme of this year's chair, "Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience".
iv. I am pleased to see steady progress in the three pillars of cooperation which Japan and ASEAN set forth as "Trusted Partners" on the occasion of the Commemorative Summit for the 50th Year of ASEAN-Japan Friendship and Cooperation last year.
(a) "Heart-to-Heart Partners across Generation"
More than 100 "NIHONGO Partners'' have already been dispatched to ASEAN countries through the "Partnership to Co-create a Future with the Next Generation: WA Project 2.0."
(b) "Partners for Co-creation of Economy and Society of the Future"
- Under the Japan-ASEAN Comprehensive Connectivity Initiative, various projects are underway in a wide range of areas including both structural and non-structural aspects, including digital technology, transport infrastructure development and electricity connectivity. Japan is also promoting regional financial cooperation.
- Moreover, Japan has decided to send Japanese experts to the ASEAN Centre for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases (ACPHEED) and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre).
- In addition to these efforts, Japan will promote cooperation to address emerging issues such as Green Transformation (GX) and Digital Transformation (DX) in order to jointly shape a vibrant future of the region.
- Regarding GX, Japan will organize the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) Leaders Meeting tomorrow on October 11th to jointly promote decarbonization efforts in the region while ensuring economic growth and stable energy supply.
- As for DX, we will develop a roadmap for concrete cooperation, including the development of AI human resources in cooperation with the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA). We will also promote various initiatives, including the development of 5G infrastructure and the establishment of a platform for small and medium-sized enterprises.
(c) "Partners for Peace and Stability"
- Japan is strengthening maritime security by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement.
- Japan is also working to strengthen economic security, including supply chain resilience, through human resource development and financial cooperation. We are also strengthening cyber security, including cooperation through the ASEAN-Japan Cyber Security Capacity Building Center (AJCCBC). We will continue to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries to safeguard the future together.
(2) The ASEAN countries congratulated Prime Minister Ishiba on his appointment, expressed their high regard for cooperation with Japan and welcomed the steady progress in ASEAN-Japan cooperation. They also expressed high expectations for deepening cooperation with Japan, including in new areas such as DX and GX. They also noted that Japan's FOIP is complementary to the AOIP and expressed hope for further cooperation.
(3) In response, Prime Minister Ishiba gave his remarks as outlined below:
i. I have heard high expectations from ASEAN countries for cooperation with Japan, including human exchange, connectivity, DX and GX, and I have renewed my determination to strengthen ASEAN-Japan cooperation.
ii. I hope that next year's Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan would be a good opportunity for many people from ASEAN to visit Japan.
iii. I look forward to working with the ASEAN leaders to strengthen both bilateral and ASEAN-Japan relations, and to pave the way for the future together as "Trusted Partners" with "heart to heart" connection.
2. Regional and International Issues
(1) ASEAN countries mentioned that unilateral actions in the East and South China Seas are undermining the stability in the region, the importance of peaceful settlements of disputes based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as well as the importance of implementation of UN Security Council resolutions by North Korea, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and resolution of humanitarian issues including the abductions issue. They also expressed appreciation to Japan's support for the "Five Point Consensus" on Myanmar and mentioned the importance of a peaceful resolution to the situation in the Middle East.
(2) In response, Prime Minister Ishiba stated as outlined below:
i. General principles
- The security environment in the Indo-Pacific region is becoming increasingly severe due to growing uncertainties in the international community.
- The principles of the Charter of the United Nations, such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the peaceful settlements of disputes in accordance with international law, and renunciation of the use of force, are becoming increasingly important. Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion cannot be tolerated anywhere in the world. Japan consistently and strongly supports the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and will work with ASEAN to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
ii. East China Sea, South China Sea and Taiwan
- With regard to maritime issues, Japan strongly opposes continuing and intensifying activities that infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and provocative military activities in the East China Sea. Japan is also seriously concerned about the continuing and intensifying militarization and coercive activities in the South China Sea.
- Any unjust claims of maritime interests and activities that do not align with the UNCLOS are unacceptable. Japan consistently upholds the rule of law at sea and the peaceful settlement of disputes based on international law.
- Peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are important for the region and the international community.
- Japan will continue to maintain close communication with China at all levels.
iii. North Korea
- Japan is seriously concerned about the advancement of North Korea's nuclear and missile activities in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
- Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are in our common interest. In order to uphold the international non-proliferation regime, a robust response of the international community toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea is critical, and Japan requests cooperation of ASEAN countries to this end.
- Japan calls for the continued understanding and cooperation from ASEAN countries toward the immediate resolution of the abductions issue.
iv. Situation in Myanmar
- Japan is seriously concerned with the situation in Myanmar and calls for an improvement in the situation.
- Japan will continue to offer maximum support to ASEAN's efforts, including the implementation of the "Five-Point Consensus," and provide humanitarian assistance.
v. Russia's aggression against Ukraine
- The ongoing Russia's aggression against Ukraine is a blatant breach of international law.
- It is necessary to realize a just and lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible. Japan will continue to support Ukraine and impose sanctions against Russia.
vi. Middle East
- It is clear that the escalation of the situation in the Middle East is extremely dangerous for the region and the international community as a whole.
- Now is the time for us to unite in urging all parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint. Japan is also making its utmost diplomatic efforts.
- Japan would like to work together to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza as an urgent issue.
3. Before his closing remarks, Prime Minister Ishiba reiterated Japan's consistent support for Timor-Leste's full membership in ASEAN, to which Prime Minister Gusmao of Timor-Leste said in Japanese, "Arigato (Thank you)."
