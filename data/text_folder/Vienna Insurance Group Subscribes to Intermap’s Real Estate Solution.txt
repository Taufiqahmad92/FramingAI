Providing insurers with reliable and accurate property valuation for underwriting
DENVER, Oct. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intermap Technologies (TSX: IMP; OTCQB: ITMSF) (Intermap or the Company), a global leader in 3D geospatial products and intelligence solutions, today announced that eská podnikatelská pojiovna (PP), a subsidiary of the Vienna Insurance Group, has subscribed to Intermaps innovative solution for determining the market price of real estate properties.
Intermap and its partner Dataligence recently launched a solution that combines Intermaps data and analytics for underwriting, reinsurance and claims with Dataligences world-class pricing and real estate databases. PP, a long-term user of Intermaps Aquarius RMA, is the newest major EU insurance group customer to adopt this innovative solution.
This advanced property valuation process meets the growing demand for digitized property services in the Czech market, improving transparency in real estate data.
By utilizing Intermaps up-to-date flood and natural hazard maps within its Aquarius RMA software, alongside Dataligences extensive real estate data, this solution enables accurate online property valuation. It processes comprehensive databases of flood, natural hazard, and real estate information to streamline transactions, providing insurers with reliable and precise property valuations for underwriting purposes.
We chose this innovative solution because it will make it easier and more convenient for our clients to arrange insurance. At the same time, we see our partners as technology leaders whose data is accurate, robust and reliable, said Michal imon, manager of non-life insurance at eská podnikatelská pojiovna.
We are always excited when we find new ways to use our world-class pricing and real estate datasets, said Milan Roek, founder and CEO of Dataligence. Last year, we made our innovative tools available to the general public through the www.hypox.cz app, and the continued integration of online pricing into insurance companies systems embodies our vision for modern insurance and real estate services, where clients don't have to worry about anything, yet their assets are reliably protected.
Intermaps solutions for the insurance market use proprietary datasets that are integrated into insurance processes to provide insurers with comprehensive tools that can be used throughout a portfolio lifecycle, said Patrick A. Blott, Intermap Chairman and CEO. Our state-of-the-art software, analytics and data enable insurers to understand and underwrite natural hazard risks, then leverage data intelligence to actively manage and reinsure risk with attractive margins.
Intermaps services are more important than ever. According to Resources for the Future, the private residential flood insurance market in the United States is currently small relative to the NFIP. We estimate that private flood insurance accounts for roughly 3.5 to 4.5 percent of all primary residential flood policies currently purchased. With historic flooding recently, this demonstrates the need for dramatic increase in coverage. CoreLogic estimates Hurricane Helene industry insured loss at $10.5B  $17.5B. Uninsured losses are estimated at $20B - $30B. Moodys RMS Event Response estimates total U.S. private market insured losses from the recent Hurricanes Helene and Milton will likely range between US$35 billion and US$55 billion. This estimate is for insured losses associated with wind, storm surge, and precipitation-induced flooding from these events.
In Europe, the flood protection gap is 25%. Recent European Commission studies show that insurance premiums written should at least be doubled to reach a harmonized level of penetration equal to 50%. Intermap is uniquely positioned to meet this demand and address this need.
