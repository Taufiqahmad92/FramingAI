"With these cloud-native services for profitability and balance sheet management, we are empowering financial institutions to optimize operations, and drive more sustainable growth by using advanced analytics and integrated AI to gain critical insights, such as drain on profitability, or a risk-adjusted view of performance to immediately adjust to market realities."The suite of solutions provides a framework for multi-dimensional profitability and balance sheet management by helping financial institutions better understand profitability across business dimensions, use flexible forecast assumptions to accurately model Net Interest Income (NII), and address risk management requirements. The applications leverage the integration of Generative AI and Natural Language Generation (NLG) to enhance data interpretation by automatically generating detailed insights.Built on the high performance, security, and scalability ofOracle Cloud Infrastructure, the services useOracle Autonomous Database,Oracle Analytics, and a domain-driven microservices architecture. With quarterly updates, banks can eliminate the need for costly upgrades while benefiting from continuous innovation that helps improve total-cost-of-ownership.Oracle Profitability and Balance Sheet Management Cloud Services include:Profitability management: provides a highly scalable allocation engine that allows users to construct detailed P&L analysis using pre-packaged reports and data visualizations to model profitability across multiple dimensions, including product, customer, account, channel, business unit, geography, relationship manager, and line of business. With the solution, organizations can answer questions such as, "Which customers are the most profitable?" or "What products or services should we invest in or divest?"Funds transfer pricing: determines the spread earned on assets and liabilities, and allows for more accurate profitability assessment and effective interest rate risk management.Asset liability management: delivers accurate valuations, views of earnings stability, and balance sheet risk sensitivity through advanced analytics and scenario-based what-if analysis.Cash flow engine: measures and models cash inflows and outflows for financial instruments, and provides detailed insights into liquidity and cash management."Financial institutions are under constant pressure to improve efficiency and reduce costs, and Oracle's new cloud services directly address the challenges around automating complex tasks, reporting, and developing analytics and visualization," said Sid Dash, chief researcher, Chartis. "Moreover, the ability to analyze profitability and balance sheet risk in real-time, with the granularity that Oracle offers, will be crucial for institutions to thrive."These services are part of theOracle Financial Services Suiteof componentized and composable cloud applications.
