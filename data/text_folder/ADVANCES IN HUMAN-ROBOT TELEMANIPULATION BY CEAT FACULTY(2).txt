Dr. Lingfeng Tao, assistant professor and coordinator of mechatronics and robotics, and Dr. He Bai, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, both from the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology, have received a National Science Foundation EAGER award totaling $160,000 to fund
their research on developing advancements to telemanipulation technologies that could
transform healthcare, disaster response and more.
Their project aims to advance teleoperation systems for robotic hands by transitioning
from basic motion imitation to developing more intuitive and outcome-driven control
systems. These advancements have the potential to significantly impact various industries
by enhancing the precision and effectiveness of remote robotic manipulation.
Innovative Approach to Telemanipulation
Tao and his team aim to revolutionize human-robot collaboration by integrating advanced
deep reinforcement learning algorithms and multi-modal perception systems into a bi-directional
control and feedback telemanipulation systems.
Dr. Tao with students Haoyang Wang and Haoran Guo who assisted with the research.
These systems integrate diverse sensory technologies, including inertial measurement
units, computer vision methods and convolutional neural networks, enabling the AI-controlled
robot to accurately interpret and execute human commands based on desired task outcomes.
The systems utilize multiple feedback devices - such as visual, auditory and haptic
- to create a cohesive and intuitive experience for the operator. This system enhances
human-robot interaction by providing comprehensive feedback, enabling the operator
to make more informed decisions and perform tasks more effectively and safely.
"Our approach allows robots to interpret and execute human commands more accurately
while minimizing the cognitive and physical demands on operators," Tao said. "This
will make telemanipulation systems much easier to learn and use, requiring less training
and making the technology more accessible across different sectors."
Applications Across Key Industries
The potential applications of this research span several critical industries:
* Health Care: Enhanced precision in telesurgery, allowing surgeons to perform delicate procedures
remotely with improved control and safety.
* Disaster Response: Remote handling of hazardous materials or navigating through dangerous environments,
such as collapsed structures, to perform search and rescue operations without putting
human responders at risk.
* Space and Deep-Sea Exploration: Conducting complex tasks in space or deep-sea environments where direct human involvement
is not feasible, such as assembling structures or repairing equipment.
* Manufacturing: Automating assembly lines where precise, flexible manipulation of objects is required,
improving efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention in repetitive or
dangerous tasks.
Inspiring the Next Generation
In addition to its industrial applications, this research is also helping to inspire
future innovators. The team is actively involved in K-12 STEM education, bringing
hands-on robotics demonstrations to students through outreach activities like 4-H
Robotics Exploration Day and mentorship for the Stillwater High School Robotics Team.
"We want to inspire students by showing how advanced robotics can solve real-world
problems," Tao said.
The research team is planning more educational initiatives, including summer camps
and short lectures.
Looking Ahead
Tao notes that the most crucial aspect of this research is its focus on enhancing
human-robot collaboration in complex and safety-critical tasks. By leveraging advanced
perception systems, this research has the potential to set new standards in telemanipulation,
making human-robot teaming safer, more precise and more intuitive across multiple
industries.
"We're excited to address these challenges and create solutions that will impact industries
worldwide," Bai said.
