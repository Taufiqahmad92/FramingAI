(Continued from Part 1 of 11)
TITLE I - AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS
Processing, Research, and Marketing
Office of the Secretary
(INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)
Appropriations, 2024 ... $58,292,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 103,025,000
Committee recommendation ... 63,038,000
The Secretary of Agriculture, assisted by the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries, Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and members of their immediate staffs, directs and coordinates the work of the United States Department of Agriculture [USDA]. This includes developing policy, maintaining relationships with agricultural organizations and others in the development of farm programs, and maintaining liaison with the Executive Office of the President and Members of Congress on all matters pertaining to agricultural policy.
The general authority of the Secretary to supervise and control the work of the Department is contained in the Organic Act (Public Law 101-624). The delegation of regulatory functions to Department employees and authorization of appropriations to carry out these functions is contained in 7 U.S.C. 450c-450g.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $63,038,000 for the Office of the Secretary. This includes an increase of $2,000,000 for a Polyfluoroalkyl Substances [PFAS] initiative.
The following table reflects the amount provided by the Committee for each office and activity:
* * *
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
[In thousands of dollars]
[View table in the link at bottom.]
* * *
Canadian Variety Registration.--The Committee is concerned about unfair wheat variety registration practices that negatively affect American wheat growers that export to Canada. Currently, the Canadian wheat varietal registration system is overly burdensome to many American-developed varieties, requiring multiple years of Canadian test plot data and considering agronomic factors that are not relevant to the end use attributes of the grain. This results in U.S. farmers growing very few acres of registered varieties and has limited the opportunity to increase export trade. While the relevant provisions of USMCA regarding wheat grading made important changes, additional work is needed to ensure American growers can benefit from those changes. Therefore, the Committee urges the Secretary to work with the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to prioritize conversations with the Canadian government to address trade inequities resulting from Canada's current wheat varietal registration practices.
Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives.--The Committee requests an update on the Department's effort to streamline and coordinate existing Federal programs serving colonias and farmworkers, including housing, healthcare, water infrastructure, and broadband programs, and the consideration of establishing an "Office of Colonias and Farmworker Initiatives".
Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] Obligations and Commitments.--The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate in writing 15 days prior to the obligation or commitment of any emergency funds from the CCC.
The Committee also reminds USDA that while the Secretary has broad authority to utilize the CCC for emergencies such as the recent outbreak of high pathogen avian influenza, creating programs with CCC funds that then cannot be implemented without utilizing the interchange authority, requiring additional appropriated dollars, or that will take years to obligate funding is not an appropriate use. As such, the plan required to be submitted as part of the CCC notification shall also include outyear costs for implementation and how the Department intends to operationalize the program.
Communications Services for Limited English Proficient Communities.--The Committee is supportive of efforts the Department is taking to improve communications, which should include mediums such as television and radio, to reach limited English proficient [LEP] communities. However, to improve implementation, the Committee encourages the Department to review its practices and create uniform applications across all Department agencies to strengthen communication practices to include digital, television, and radio advertising when working with limited English proficient communities. The Committee further directs each Department and agency funded by this act with annual advertising budgets to include a report on expenditures related to local media advertising to include digital, television, and radio no more than 30 days after the enactment of this act. The Committee also mandates that a portion of the advertising expenditures for LEP communications is dedicated to minority-focused media outlets to ensure equity.
Coordination.--The Committee encourages additional coordination within the Department, specifically between NRCS, FSA, and APHIS, on matters related to non-lethal wildlife conflict management methods, techniques, and resources.
Cover Crops.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Risk Management Agency, shall submit a written report, within 1 year of enactment of this act, on how the Department can streamline opportunities for farmers to insure primary and secondary crops with revenue streams resulting from biofuel use, with particular reference tocarinata, pennycress, camelina, and other oilseeds.
Farm and Food System Workforce.--The Committee encourages department to establish an "Office of the Farm and Food System Workforce" to improve awareness and access to Federal programs for farm and food system workers, ensure inclusive communication between the Federal Government and these workers, and to provide recommendations and technical assistance across the Federal Government as it relates to these workers. The Secretary shall submit a report within 180 days of the enactment of this act regarding departmental actions, policies, and methods for: (1) establishing goals and objectives of the department to increase participation in established programs for farm and food system workers; (2) assessing the effectiveness of department outreach programs targeted towards these workers; (3) collaborating with and providing input to the agencies and offices of the department on programmatic and policy decisions affecting these workers; and (4) determining the barriers that farm and food system workers face to accessing department programs.
Federal Trust and Treaty Responsibilities.--The Committee reminds agencies funded by this act of their obligation to uphold the Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes and Federal obligations to the Native Hawaiian Community. This includes upholding treaty and reserved rights, and any other rights and obligations under Federal law; supporting self- determination efforts by Native communities; fulfilling obligations under Presidential Memoranda and Executive Orders; and conducting early and robust government-to-government consultation with Tribes, and meaningful outreach and engagement with Native Hawaiians.
Fertilizer Production Expansion Program [FPEP].--The Committee appreciates the work the Department has done though the FPEP to expand domestic production of fertilizer and other inputs to increase competition and drive costs down for producers. In future FPEP funding rounds and any other programs or mechanisms to support domestic fertilizer production expansion, the Committee encourages the Secretary to prioritize the production of nitrogenous fertilizers with low- to no- carbon emissions.
Institute for Rural Partnerships.--The Committee recognized the unique challenges faced by rural communities when it provided funding in fiscal year 2024 to continue three Institutes for Rural Partnerships in geographically diverse locations to identify and support community, statewide and regional partnership to address these challenges. As rural challenges evolve, the continued need for these Institutes is clear. Therefore, the Committee provides $6,000,000 to be divided equally to continue the Institute for Rural Partnerships at established land-grant universities including the Auburn University Partnership Institute at Auburn University, the Wisconsin Rural Partnership Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships at the University of Vermont, which were originally funded in fiscal year 2022. Funding will support focused research and applied transitional needs locally and regionally.
Office of Tribal Relations.--The Committee supports elevating the Office of Tribal Relations to an Assistant Secretary level and encourages the Secretary to evaluate the resources needed.
Resource Conservation and Development Councils.--Since 1964, the Resource Conservation and Development [RC&D] Councils have worked at the grassroots level with local leaders to plan, develop, and carry out programs for land and water conservation and management. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider the maximum practical use of RC&D Councils, where such RC&D Councils meet agency performance requirements, in the delivery of USDA programs and services.
School Meals.--The Committee recognizes that many rural and virtual public schools may otherwise qualify for school meal programs but lack a congregate setting. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider allowing rural and virtual public school students to access their meals in non-congregate settings.
Seafood Industry Liaison.--The Committee provides $650,000 to establish a position in the Office of the Secretary solely responsible for the effective coordination of seafood policies and activities within the Department, and in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, relating to the support of domestically harvested and processed wild and farmed seafood.
Soil Carbon Monitoring.--The Committee supports the department's efforts to establish a Soil Carbon Monitoring Network. The Committee notes that additional details on program structure and plans--such as standardized methodologies, data sets to be used, plans to harmonize data sets, and more--are necessary and currently lacking. The Committee directs the department, in close collaboration with experts, to conduct a systematic review of existing USDA and Federal Government soil carbon monitoring methodologies, such as, methodologies that may have been developed by the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network, Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the National Ecological Observatory Network, or other networks, in order to develop a standardized soil carbon monitoring methodology that is reflective of current best practices and ensures the scientific rigor necessary to accurately measure and monitor soil carbon stocks and fluctuations over time and across regions, soil types, and various production systems. The Committee encourages USDA to utilize the standardized methodology developed from this review to ensure that the Soil Carbon Monitoring Network is grounded in shared data measurements and standards to enable large-scale data analysis and insights.
Tribal Self-Determination.--The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a plan for expanding Tribal self- determination beyond the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and Tribal Forestry program pilots, including, where possible, through expanding 638 contract authority.
Tropical and Sub-Tropical Agriculture.--The Committee notes the unique value of tropical agricultural crops, and directs the Department to protect the branding of processed crops, such as macadamia nuts and coffee, under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, and its implementing regulations. The Committee is also concerned that these tropical crops are vulnerable to invasive disease entities, and directs the Department to provide a report on the resources needed to improve enforcement of 7 CFR 319.73-2 in order to protect domestic tropical and subtropical agriculture.
Voting-Related Activities.--The Committee notes that the Department has not yet provided the briefing required under this heading in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 118-42. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide to the Committee a briefing, no later than 90 days after enactment of this act, regarding any strategic plans developed by the department since January 20, 2021 outlining the ways the department has promoted voter registration and voter participation.

Appropriations, 2024 ... $111,561,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 114,024,000
Committee recommendation ... 111,561,000
The Office of Inspector General [OIG] was established on October 12, 1978, by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-452). This act expanded and provided specific authorities for the activities of OIG which had previously been carried out under the general authorities of the Secretary.
The Office is administered by an inspector general who reports directly to the Secretary. Functions and responsibilities of this Office include direction and control of audit and investigative activities within the Department, formulation of audit and investigative policies and procedures regarding Department programs and operations, and analysis and coordination of program-related audit and investigation activities performed by other Department agencies.
The activities of this Office are designed to assure compliance with existing laws, policies, regulations, and programs of the Department's agencies and to provide appropriate officials with the means for prompt corrective action where deviations have occurred. The scope of audit and investigative activities is large and includes administrative, program, and criminal matters. These activities are coordinated, when appropriate, with various audit and investigative agencies of the executive and legislative branches of the Government.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $111,561,000 for the Office of Inspector General.
Animal Welfare.--The Committee is concerned about illegal animal fighting activity that subjects animals to cruel conditions and has the potential to spread illnesses such as virulent Newcastle disease and avian flu. The OIG is encouraged to combat this illegal activity and to increase its efforts to investigate dogfighting and cockfighting operations as soon as there is any evidence of such illegal activity. The OIG is also encouraged to work with Federal partners like the U.S. Postal Service and U.S. Department of Justice to examine the prevalence of the illegal shipment of game-fowl used in cockfighting.
The Committee also encourages the OIG to audit and investigate USDA enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and the Horse Protection Act to help improve compliance with these important laws. This should include the completion of an in- depth examination of APHIS' oversight of dog breeders with the number of in-person visits originally planned. Additionally, the Committee is concerned about the lack of meaningful enforcement of the AWA and HPA and requests that these audits should also examine what barriers exist to full enforcement of both Acts, and what if any steps can be taken to ensure that the regulated community is held accountable for violations of these Acts.
Office of the General Counsel
Appropriations, 2024 ... $60,537,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 66,581,000
Committee recommendation ... 61,981,000

COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $61,981,000 for the Office of the General Counsel. The Committee provides an increase of $1,444,000 for additional legal services.
Organic Standard Integrity.--To keep pace with new research and changing consumer demands, organic standards should be updated expeditiously to maintain integrity. The Committee encourages the Office of the General Counsel to prioritize the hiring of staff with expertise in the Organic Foods Production Act to address the backlog of organic standards updates within the National Organic Program.
Office of Ethics
Appropriations, 2024 ... $4,500,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 7,229,000
Committee recommendation ... 4,500,000
The Office of Ethics is the centralized and consolidated office implementing USDA's ethics program throughout the Department. The Office provides ethics services to all employees at the Department concerning advice, training, and guidance about compliance with conflict of interest and impartiality rules. This includes complying with the requirements of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (Public Law 112-105) and the Office of Government Ethics regulatory requirements (5 CFR parts 2634 through 2641).
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,500,000 for the Office of Ethics.
Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics
Appropriations, 2024 ... $1,384,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 1,421,000
Committee recommendation ... 2,384,000
The Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics provides direction and coordination in carrying out the laws enacted by the Congress for food and agricultural research, education, extension, and economic and statistical information. The Office has oversight and management responsibilities for the Agricultural Research Service [ARS]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture [NIFA]; Economic Research Service [ERS]; and National Agricultural Statistics Service [NASS].
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,384,000 for the Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics.
Economic Research Service
Appropriations, 2024 ... $90,612,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 98,068,000
Committee recommendation ... 90,612,000
The Economic Research Service provides economic and other social science research and analysis for public and private decisions on agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America. The information that ERS produces is available to the general public and helps the Executive and Legislative Branches develop, administer, and evaluate agricultural and rural policies and programs.
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends an appropriation of $90,612,000 for the Economic Research Service.
Data Collection on Religiously Informed Diets.--The Committee appreciates Department's efforts to improve access to kosher and halal food for Americans with religiously informed diets. However, the Committee remains concerned about the gaps that still exist between the need and the products currently available. While studies to collect data in this area have been conducted in individual States, there is a lack of data available at the National level. The Committee encourages ERS to track and report on the scope, scale and location of the needs of Americans with religiously informed diets.
International Commodity Trade.--The Committee recognizes the economic importance of international trade for U.S. agricultural commodities and believes that producers and markets would benefit from having access to additional data on the country of destination or origin of those commodities. The Committee appreciates that ERS has begun work on the top five agricultural commodity exports and imports by State and to identify the country of destination or origin of those commodities. The Committee directs ERS to publish this data on a quarterly basis in language that is clear, concise, well- organized, and user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary complexity so that it is easier for members of the general public to understand.
Midwest Center of Agricultural Policy.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to continue standing up the new Midwest policy center and continues providing support for the existing regional centers.
Organic Data Analysis.--The organic industry has grown at a tremendous rate over the past several years and accurate data for the production, pricing, and marketing of organic products is essential. Therefore, the Committee encourages ERS to continue and expand the efforts relating to organic data analysis.
National Agricultural Statistics Service
Appropriations, 2024 ... $187,513,000
Budget estimate, 2025 ... 195,964,000
Committee recommendation ... 193,513,000
The National Agricultural Statistics Service administers the Department's program of collecting and publishing current national, State, and county agricultural statistics. These statistics provide accurate and timely projections of current agricultural production and measures of the economic and environmental welfare of the agricultural sector, which are essential for making effective policy, production, and marketing decisions. NASS also furnishes statistical services to other USDA and Federal agencies in support of their missions and provides consulting, technical assistance, and training to developing countries.
