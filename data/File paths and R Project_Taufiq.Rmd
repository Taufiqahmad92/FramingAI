#This assignment is for the practice of file paths for current and future assignment working


## Here is file my one asisgnment 
### I am taling here about small steps to show hoe file paths works for an assignment. 

#Impoertant libraries 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)
library(textdata)
library(tidytext)
library(quanteda)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
library(rio)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# Load necessary library for PDF text extraction
# Make sure the 'pdftools' package is installed. If not, install it using install.packages("pdftools")
library(pdftools)

# Step 1: Reading the PDF file and converting it into text
# '../data/FramingAI.PDF' refers to a PDF file named 'FramingAI.PDF' located in the 'data' folder, one level up from the current working directory
text <- pdf_text("../data/FramingAI.PDF")  
# The pdf_text() function extracts text from each page of the PDF and returns a character vector

# Step 2: Writing the extracted text to a plain text file
# The extracted text is saved as 'FramingAI.text' in the same 'data' directory

writeLines(text, "../data/FramingAI.text")  

# Step 3: Defining the file path to the newly created text file

file_path <- "../data/FramingAI.text"  


# This variable holds the relative path to the text file for further processing

# Step 4: Reading the text data from the file

# readLines() reads the text file line by line into a character vector
text_data <- readLines(file_path)  

# Step 5: Combining all lines of text into a single string separated by newline characters



# This is useful for splitting the text into separate documents later
text_combined <- paste(text_data, collapse = "\n")  

# Step 6: Splitting the combined text into individual documents
# The delimiter "End of Document" is used to identify where one document ends and the next begins


documents <- strsplit(text_combined, "End of Document")[[1]]  
# strsplit() returns a list; [[1]] extracts the first element, which is the vector of split documents

# Step 7: Defining the output directory where extracted documents will be saved


# '../data/extracted' is a folder named 'extracted' inside the 'data' directory, one level up from the current working directory


output_dir <- "../data/extracted"  

# Step 8: Looping through each document and writing them to separate text files


for (i in seq_along(documents)) {
  
  output_file <- file.path(output_dir, paste0("FramingAI_extracted", i, ".txt"))
  
  # Writing the current document's text to the corresponding output file
  writeLines(documents[[i]], output_file)  
}

# Step 9: Displaying the number of files created
cat("Files created:", length(documents), "\n")  

# This helps verify that all documents have been successfully extracted and saved

# Step 10: Reading a specific extracted file for further processing
# Here, we're reading the first extracted document 'FramingAI_extracted1.txt' from the 'extracted' folder

FramingAI_index <- readLines("../data/extracted/FramingAI_extracted1.txt")  
# readLines() reads the file line by line into a character vector

# Step 11: Extracting specific lines from the read file
# Here, lines 20 to 2360 are extracted for analysis or further processing


extracted_lines <- FramingAI_index[20:2360]  

# Step 12: Displaying the first 20 lines of the extracted content
cat(head(extracted_lines, 20), sep = "\n")  
# head() retrieves the first 20 elements from 'extracted_lines'
# sep = "\n" ensures each line is printed on a new line in the console

# Step 13: Converting the extracted lines into a data frame
# This structure is useful for further data manipulation and analysis


extracted_lines <- extracted_lines |> 
  as.data.frame()  
# The pipe operator |> passes 'extracted_lines' to as.data.frame()
