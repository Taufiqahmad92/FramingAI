Dividend

The HPE Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.13 per share on the company's common stock,
payable on October 18, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 19, 2024.

Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Outlook

HPE estimates revenue to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion. HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be
in the range of $0.76 to $0.81 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.57. Fiscal 2024
fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes net after-tax gain of approximately $0.24 per diluted share
primarily related to H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C, offset by acquisition, disposition and
other related charges, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and transformation
costs.

Fiscal 2024 Outlook

HPE estimates fiscal 2024 revenue growth of 1% to 3%, in constant currency(1)(5), and fiscal 2024 GAAP
operating profit growth to be in the range of 2% to 6% and non-GAAP operating profit(1)(4) growth to be flat to 2%.
HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $1.68 and $1.73 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to
be in the range of $1.92 and $1.97. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude net after-tax
adjustments of approximately $0.24 per diluted share, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense,
acquisition, disposition and other related charges, amortization of intangible assets, and transformation costs, offset
by H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C. HPE estimates free cash flow(1)(3)(5) of $1.9 billion.

H3C Technologies Co., Limited Update

HPE also notes that on September 4, 2024, the company received proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the
partial sale of its equity position in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (representing 30% of all H3C shares) from

                                                                                                 Page 3 of 22

Unisplendour International Technology Limited. The financial impact of this transaction will be reflected in HPE's Q4
FY24 and full year FY24 earnings announcement later this year.

1 A description of HPE's use of non-GAAP financial information is provided below under "Use of non-GAAP
financial information and key performance metrics."

2 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate ("ARR") is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption
Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform
services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and
interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-
Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR
should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

3 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant
& equipment ("PP&E") and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of
exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.?

4 FY24 non-GAAP operating profit excludes costs of approximately $1.0 billion primarily related to stock-based
compensation expense, acquisition, disposition and other related charges, amortization of intangible assets, and
transformation costs, offset by H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C.

5 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception
provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a reconciliation
to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot
predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements
could have a material impact on the Company's reported GAAP results for the guidance period. Refer to the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise's condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on
a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial
measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP
gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-
GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP
income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow ("FCF").
Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP
diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and FCF. Reconciliations of each of these non-
GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are
included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an
explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management uses these non-GAAP measures to
evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise's decision to use these non-GAAP
measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful

information to investors is included further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings
from operations), operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), net earnings,
diluted net earnings per share, and cash flow from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents
annualized revenue run-rate ("ARR") as performance metric. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of
the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-
cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating
leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service ("SaaS"), software consumption
revenue, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. ARR should be
viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these
items.

  (1)     Interest and other, net includes tax indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic
          benefit cost, and interest and other, net.

  (2)     Other adjustments includes non-service net periodic benefit cost and tax indemnification and other
          adjustments.

  (3)     As previously disclosed, effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, in order to align
          the segment financial reporting more closely with its business structure, the Company established two
          new reportable segments, Hybrid Cloud and Server. Hybrid Cloud includes the historical Storage
          segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure through
          the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under the Compute and the
          High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence ("HPC & AI") segments), Private Cloud, and
          Software (previously reported under the Corporate Investments and Other segment). The Server
          segment combines the previously separately reported Compute and HPC & AI segments, with
          adjustments for certain product lines that are now reported in Hybrid Cloud. Additionally, certain
          products and services previously reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment were moved
          to be reported in the Hybrid Cloud segment, and the Athonet business and certain components of the
          Communications and Media Solutions business, both previously reported in the financial results for

                                                                                               Page 18 of 22

               Corporate Investments and Other, moved to be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment.

               As a result, the Company's new organizational structure consists of the following segments: (i) Server;
               (ii) Hybrid Cloud; (iii) Intelligent Edge; (iv) Financial Services; and (v) Corporate Investments and Other.
               The Company began reporting under this re-aligned segment structure beginning with the results of the
               first quarter of fiscal 2024.

               The Company has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest
               period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for
               each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard
               Enterprise's previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share or total
               assets.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise's condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on
a GAAP basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides non-GAAP financial measures including revenue on a constant
currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin,
non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings,
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue
growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth,
and FCF.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP in the
United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net
revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP
measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure
most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) is earnings from
operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a
percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income
tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP
measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share.
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations. Reconciliations of each of these
non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods
are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that providing the non-GAAP financial measures stated above, in addition to
the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by Hewlett
Packard Enterprise's management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results "through the eyes" of management. Hewlett Packard Enterprise further
believes that providing this information provides Hewlett Packard Enterprise's investors with a supplemental view to
understand the Company's historical and prospective operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the
methodology and information used by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate and measure such
performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates the comparisons of Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that supplement
their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.

Economic substance of and material limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures used by Hewlett
Packard Enterprise

                                                                                               Page 19 of 22

                                        revenue growth; profit increases

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the
comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating the Company's past and future
performance, without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of
the U.S. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the
stock-based compensation expense, disaster (recovery) charges, and divestiture related exit costs. Non-GAAP
operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations) and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings
from operations as a percentage of net revenue) consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as
a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and charges relating to the amortization of
intangible assets, transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net
earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share
excluding the charges previously stated, as well as earnings from equity interests, gain or loss on equity
investments, other adjustments, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain
income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess
tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with
each non-GAAP item.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that excluding the items mentioned above from the non-GAAP financial
measures provides a supplemental view to management and investors of its consolidated financial performance
and presents the financial results of the business without costs that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management
does not believe to be reflective of ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact
on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting their use as analytical tools. These limitations are
discussed below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. More specifically, Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:
    •   Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and excludes
        these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly
        impacted by the timing and magnitude of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's acquisitions. Hewlett Packard
        Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily
        because they are non-cash expenses and the Company's internal benchmarking analyses evidence that
        many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset
        amortization. Although this does not directly affect Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cash position, the loss in
        value of intangible assets over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.
    •   Transformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and
        Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to
        transform the Company's IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment
        charges on real estate identified as part of the initiatives. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these costs
        as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017
        and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure
        following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product
        portfolio in fiscal 2020. The HPE Next Plan and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan are
        substantially complete. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from the non-GAAP financial
        measures, as stated above, is to provide a supplemental measure of the Company's operating results that
        do not include material HPE Next Plan and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as the
        Company's management does not believe such costs to be reflective of its ongoing operating cost
        structure. Further, the transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have
        been materially declining since 2021 and the Company does not expect these costs to be material. Hewlett
        Packard Enterprises management believes non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to
        management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.
    •   Disaster (recovery) charges are primarily related to the exit of the Company's businesses in Russia and
        Belarus, and include credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned
        assets. Disaster charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs. Hewlett Packard Enterprise

                                                                                           Page 20 of 22
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Reports Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results Accelerating AI demand drives HPE
                                    revenue growth; profit increases

    excludes Disaster (recovery) charges from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-
    recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of the Company's business.
•   Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of
    those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees,
    Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP
    measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses, and the Company's internal benchmarking
    analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures
    excluding stock-based compensation expense.
•   Divestiture related exit costs include expenses associated with certain disposal activities. On May 23,
    2024, HPE announced plans to divest the Company's Communication Technology Group ("CTG")
    business. CTG is included in our Communications and Media Solutions business, which is reported in the
    Corporate Investments and Other segment. We consider this divestiture to be a discrete event. We exclude
    these costs as these are non-recurring exit costs to eliminate stranded costs of this business. In addition,
    our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP
    financial measures excluding these charges.
•   Hewlett Packard Enterprise incurs costs related to its acquisition, disposition and other related charges.
    The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated
    as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, these
    charges were driven by costs associated with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, in addition to
    prior acquisitions of Axis, Athonet and OpsRamp. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023,
    these charges were driven by acquisitions of Axis, Zerto, Athonet and OpsRamp. Charges may also
    include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in
    connection with certain dispositions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management considers these
    acquisitions and divestitures to be discrete events. The Company excludes these costs as these expenses
    are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of its
    acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the Company's internal benchmarking analyses evidence that
    many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.
•   During the three and six months ended April 30, 2024, we stopped reporting H3C earnings in our non-
    GAAP results due to the planned divestiture of the H3C investment. Per the terms of the original Put Share
    Purchase Agreement described in Note 20 "Equity Method Investments" to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
    October 31, 2023, we weren't anticipating receiving dividends from this investment prospectively. However,
    on May 24, 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Put Share Purchase Agreement and an
    Agreement on Subsequent Arrangements, both with UNIS, as described in the Form 8-K filed with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission on May 24, 2024, which, taken together, revise the arrangements
    governing the aforementioned sale as previously set forth in the original Put Share Purchase Agreement.
    For the three months ended July 31, 2024, the adjustment to earnings from equity interests represents our
    expectation at such time to divest 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C in fiscal 2024. On
    September 4, 2024, we divested 30% of the total issued share capital of H3C. We continue to possess the
    option to sell the remaining 19% of the total issued share capital of H3C at a later date. Prospectively, the
    adjustment to earnings from equity interests will incorporate the completed divestment of 30% of the total
    issued share capital of H3C. All periods presented include the amortization of the basis difference in our
    investment. For the nine months ended July 31, 2023, this adjustment also included our portion of
    intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. We believe that eliminating these amounts for purposes of
    calculating non-GAAP financial measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance.
•   Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes gains and losses (including impairments) on its non-marketable
    equity investments because the Company does not believe they are reflective of normal continuing
    business operations. These adjustments are reflected in Interest and other, net in the Condensed
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company believes eliminating these adjustments for the
    purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of its current operating performance.

                                                                                               Page 21 of 22

                                        revenue growth; profit increases

    •   Hewlett Packard Enterprise utilizes a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to
        provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly
        related to the Company's operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this
        long-term rate, Hewlett Packard Enterprise evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate
        assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors
        including Hewlett Packard Enterprise's expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and
        current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where Hewlett Packard Enterprise
        operates. For fiscal 2024, the Company will use a projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 15%, which
        reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP income
        tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax
        environment, significant changes in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's geographic earnings mix including due to
        acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company's strategy or business operations. The Company will
        re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. For fiscal 2023, the Company had a non-GAAP tax rate of
        14%. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management believes that making these adjustments for purposes of
        calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of the Company's current operating
        performance and comparisons to past operating results.
    •   FCF is defined as cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant &
        equipment ("PP&E") and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect
        of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the
        total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management and investors
        can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in the Company's
        businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating its historical and prospective
        liquidity.

Compensation for material limitations with use of non-GAAP financial measures

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's results as reported under
GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material
impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other
companies (limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full
economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets. Hewlett Packard Enterprise compensates for these limitations
on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial
measures only as a supplement. Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP
financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this quarter and prior periods within
this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and Hewlett
Packard Enterprise encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully.
