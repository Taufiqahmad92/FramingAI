The following information was released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences:

China has launched a key open lab that will provide high-quality services for the energy industry and facilitate the
application of meteorological research in energy exploration and exploitation.

The lab was jointly established by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Public Meteorological Service
Center, China Huaneng Group Co., Ltd., and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.

The establishment of the lab is a milestone in promoting the construction of a new electric power system in China
due to the close relationship between meteorology and energy industry, Shu Yinbiao, an academician of the
Chinese Academy of Engineering, who serves as the chairman of the lab's academic committee, was quoted as
saying by the ScienceNet.cn on Sunday.

Meteorology is closely related to energy, particularly the development and operation of the industries of renewable
energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, and hydroelectric power, which are greatly influenced by
weather and climate conditions, according to Shen Yanbo, the lab director.

The lab will focus on the construction of new energy systems and new electric power systems, carrying out
research in areas such as wind and solar energy assessment and forecasting, meteorological disaster warning,
artificial intelligence applications, offshore wind power, and intelligent operation and maintenance of new energy
industry, said Shen.(Xinhua)
