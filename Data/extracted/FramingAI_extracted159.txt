ready to play its part in this shared journey and we will champion international collaboration and actively contribute
to the development of global standards.

Doreen Bogdan-Martin, ITU Secretary-General, in her address invoked Prime Minister Narendra Modis words
saying Let us keep the Honorable Prime Minister Modis words in mind as we transform WTSA outcomes into
action. By keeping the principles of security, dignity and equity at the center of our efforts. Lets continue this journey
towards one shared digital future. One that is technically strong and built on a solid foundation of standards. One
that is ethically sound, with innovation and inclusion at its very core.

Speaking at the event, Dr. Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar, Minister of State for Communications and Rural
Development said Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has showcased its
commitment to global leadership through strategic partnerships, groundbreaking research, and innovation-driven
development, reaffirming its position at the forefront of the digital revolution.

Key proposals by India include:

1. A new Resolution on Enhancing the standardization activities on Digital Public Infrastructure

2. A new Resolution on Standardization activities of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector on AI
technologies in support of telecommunications/ Information and Communication Technology (ICT),

Other new ITU-T Resolutions supported by India include:

3. Enhancing the standardization activities on sustainable digital transformation

4. Promoting and strengthening metaverse standardization

5. Promoting and Strengthening Standardization Activities for Vehicular Communications

6. Strategic Planning in ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector;

7. Provision of handset-derived caller location information for emergency communications

8. Enhancing the engagement of next generation experts in ITU-T standardization activities.

These initiatives not only bolster Indias role as leader in the areas of telecommunication/ Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), but also align seamlessly with the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis vision for
a robust Digital Public Infrastructure, as articulated during Indias G-20 Presidency. His emphasis on creating a
global framework for digital technology underscores the importance of these resolutions for global governance.
These resolutions are also aligned with PM Modis four pillars of Digital India - Low-priced devices, extensive reach
of digital connectivity to every nook and corner of the country, easily accessible data and goal of Digital First.

Additionally, India has also contributed significantly to the revision of approximately 25 existing resolutions. Notable
approvals and consensus reached include Collaboration with ISO/IEC, Telecom Numbering Management,
Cybersecurity, Telecommunication/ICT accessibility for persons with disabilities, and ICT and Environment/Climate
Change. This progress reflects a collaborative spirit, with many resolutions achieving consensus without changes,
reinforcing a unified approach to global standards.

Indias active participation has not only highlighted its leadership in telecommunications but has also garnered
support from numerous countries, including the USA, UK, Brazil, China, Japan, and Australia. Indias chairmanship
of the event also saw many long discussed structural reforms carried out successfully, like creating a new Study
Group based on merger of SG9 and SG16, having not more than one chair from one country and finalization of
leadership positions despite lot of divergent views.

                                                                               Page 3 of 3
