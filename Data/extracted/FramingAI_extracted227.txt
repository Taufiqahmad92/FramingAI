Rock, TEXAS, Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- News summaryDell Integrated Rack 7000 offers liquid cooled high
density compute infrastructure with scalable power managementDell PowerEdge XE9712 is an NVIDIA GB200
NVL72-based platform targeted toward the largest AI GPU clusters for large language model (LLM) training and
real-time inferenceDell PowerEdge M7725 is a direct-to-chip liquid cooled 5th Gen AMD EPYC-based system for
high-performance, dense computeDell PowerScale advancements deliver increased capacity, accelerate AI
workload performance and improve data discoverabilityDell Data Lakehouse and Dell Services simplify how
customers access and manage their dataDell Generative AI Solutions with Intel provide AI optimized solutions for
any size workloadFull storyDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) introduces new integrated rack-scalable systems,
server, storage and data management innovations to the Dell AI Factory, powering high density computing and AI
workloads at scale."Today's data centers can't keep up with the demands of AI, requiring high density compute and
liquid cooling innovations with modular, flexible and efficient designs," said Arthur Lewis, president, Infrastructure
Solutions Group, Dell Technologies. "These new systems deliver the performance needed for organizations to
remain competitive in the fast-evolving AI landscape."

The future of accelerated compute with leading cooling innovationsTheDell Integrated Rack 7000
(IR7000)handles accelerated computing demands with superior density, more sustainable power management and
advanced cooling technologies. This Open Compute Project (OCP) standards-based rack is ideal for large-scale
deployment and features a futureproof design for multigeneration and heterogenous technology environments.Key
features include:Designed for density, the 21-inch Dell IR7000 is designed to support industry-leading CPU and
GPU density.Future-ready and efficient, the rack features wider, taller server sleds to accommodate the latest,
larger CPU and GPU architectures. This rack was purpose built for liquid cooling natively, capable of cooling future
deployments of up to 480KW, and is able to capture nearly 100% of heat created. Engineered for greater choice
and flexibility, this integrated rack offers support for both Dell and off-the-shelf networking.Deployments are simple
and energy-efficient with Dell Integrated Rack Scalable Systems (IRSS). IRSS delivers innovative rack-scale
infrastructure optimized for AI workloads, making the setup process seamless and efficient with a fully integrated
plug-and-play rack scale system.Dell Technologies introduces AI-ready platforms designed for the Dell
IR7000:Part of the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, the Dell PowerEdge XE9712 offers high-performance, dense
acceleration for LLM training and real-time inferencing of large-scale AI deployments. Designed for industry-leading

GPU density with NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, this platform connects up to 36 NVIDIA Grace CPUs with 72 NVIDIA
Blackwell GPUs in a rack-scale design. The 72 GPU NVLink domain acts as a single GPU for up to 30x faster real-
time trillion-parameter LLM inferencing. The liquid cooled NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 is up to 25x more efficient than the
air-cooled NVIDIA H100-powered systems.The Dell PowerEdge M7725 provides high performance dense compute
ideal for research, government, fintech and higher education environments. Designed to be deployed in the IR7000
rack, the Dell PowerEdge M7725 delivers more compute with improved serviceability scaling between 24K-27K
cores per rack, with 64 or 72 two socket nodes, powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs Front IO slots enables high
speed IO connectivity and provides seamless connectivity for demanding applications. The server's energy-efficient
form factor allows for more sustainable deployments through both direct liquid cooling (DLC) to CPUs and air
cooling via quick connect to the integrated rack.Unstructured storage and data management innovations for
the AI eraDell Technologies unstructured data storage portfolio innovations improve AI application performance
and deliver simplified global data management.Dell PowerScale, the world's first Ethernet storage certified
forNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, delivers new updates that enhance data management strategies, improve workload
performance and offer greater support for AI workloads.1Enhanced discoverability: Unlock data insights for faster
smarter decision-making using PowerScale metadata and the Dell Data Lakehouse. A forthcoming Dell open-
source document loader for NVIDIA NeMo services and RAG frameworks is designed to help customers improve
data ingestion time and decrease compute and GPU cost. Denser storage: Customers can fine tune their AI models
by training them on larger datasets with new 61TB drives that increase capacity and efficiency while reducing data
center storage footprint by half.2Improved AI performance: AI workload performance is enhanced through front-end
NVIDIA InfiniBand capabilities and 200GbE Ethernet adapter support that delivers up to 63% faster
throughput.3With new enhancements to theDell Data Lakehousedata management platform, customers can save
