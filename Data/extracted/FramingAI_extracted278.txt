        (CNN) - As Florida residents brace for another major storm, new estimates reveal Hurricane Helene caused
more than $47 billion in losses for property owners. With many insurance companies raising prices or refusing to
issue policies in disaster-prone areas, several families without coverage are now scrambling to find resources and
assistance.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.

1. Hurricane Milton

Hurricane Milton, the planet's strongest storm this year, is expected to deliver severe impacts as it barrels toward
Florida. While the storm strengthened to a Category 5 on Monday, forecasts show it will fluctuate in intensity before
ultimately making landfall Wednesday as a Category 3. Milton's dangerous eye and eyewall could come ashore
anywhere from Cedar Key in the north to Naples in the south, possibly in the Tampa or Fort Myers areas. More than
12 million people are under hurricane watches and warnings, and over 8 million are under tropical storm watches.
Many flights in the region have been canceled and a mass exodus is occurring along roads as thousands follow
mandatory evacuation orders ahead of Milton's arrival.

2. Immigration

Former President Donald Trump on Monday suggested undocumented immigrants who commit murder have "bad
genes." Trump's dehumanizing rhetoric is another example of the former president trying to stoke fears about those
in the country illegally. In a radio interview on "The Hugh Hewitt Show," Trump again distorted statistics on
immigration and crime to attack Vice President Kamala Harris as he falsely claimed she was "allowing people to
come through an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers." Separately, Harris discussed immigration in a
wide-ranging "60 Minutes" interview that aired Monday. She maintained migration is a "long-standing problem"
when asked about the Biden administration's approach to immigration policies but refused to answer whether
officials should've cracked down sooner.

3. Israel

Israel will "continue to fight," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on the anniversary of the October 7
Hamas attacks. A year into the war in Gaza, Israel's goals - including toppling Hamas, returning the hostages in
Gaza to Israel, and returning Israelis displaced by fighting with Hezbollah to their homes - seem far from reach. On
Monday, Israel intercepted dozens of strikes from multiple directions, including projectiles launched from Gaza and
Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has issued fresh evacuation orders to residents in Gaza as it ramps up its
military operation in parts of the battered enclave. However, Palestinian residents who spoke with CNN said they
fear there is no safe place to take shelter.

4. Cyberattack

American Water, the largest regulated water and wastewater utility company in the US, announced Monday that it
was the victim of a cyberattack, prompting the firm to pause billing to customers. The New Jersey-based company -
which provides services to more than 14 million people in 14 states and on 18 military installations - said it became
aware of the unauthorized activity on Thursday and immediately took protective steps, including shutting down
certain systems. American Water said staffers were working "around the clock" to investigate the nature and scope
of the attack. The company also said customers will not face late charges while its systems are unavailable.

5. Marburg virus

The CDC announced Monday that health officials will soon start screening travelers from Rwanda to the US for
Marburg virus. There are no confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease - a rare but deadly hemorrhagic disease
similar to Ebola - outside of Rwanda, and officials have said that the current risk to the US is low. However, the
Department of Health and Human Services said the CDC will begin public health entry screening next week in an
effort to reduce the risk of the importation and spread of cases. As of Monday, there have been 56 confirmed cases
of Marburg in Rwanda, with 36 people in isolation and treatment, and 12 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health.
Many of the cases are in health care workers, the CDC says.
