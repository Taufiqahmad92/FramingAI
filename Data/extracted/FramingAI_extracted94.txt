WISeKey Subsidiary WISeSat.Space Prepares for a January 2025 Launch of Next-Generation Satellite, Supporting
European Satellite Independence and IoT Connectivity

Launch Timed with WISeKey’s Davos Roundtable on Space Technology

Geneva, Switzerland – November 4, 2024: WISeKey International Holding Ltd. (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ:
WKEY), a global leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) innovations operating as a
holding company, today announces that its subsidiary, WISeSat.Space, is preparing for the mid-January 2025
launch of its next-generation satellite. This satellite, initially planned for Q4 2024, will now launch just days ahead of
WISeKey’s January 22, 2025 event in Davos, which includes a roundtable focused on advancements in space
technology.       For      more         information          about       the      Davos        annual      event     visit:

This launch represents a significant development in WISeSat.Space’s mission to provide secure IoT connectivity,
advance climate change monitoring capabilities, and support European satellite independence with cutting-edge
technology.

WISeSat.Space’s new generation of low-orbit satellites leverages compact picosatellites equipped with SEALSQ
Corp. (“SEALSQ”) (NASDAQ: LAES) semiconductor technology and WISeKey’s renowned cryptographic keys.
These integrated solutions enhance the security, performance, and resilience of satellite-based IoT systems, and
support a diverse range of applications including environmental monitoring, disaster management, smart

agriculture, and industrial IoT solutions. The satellites are specifically designed to support low-power sensors,
enabling data collection in remote and off-grid areas. WISeSat.Space’s picosatellites, which are smaller and more
cost-effective than traditional satellites, make global IoT connectivity feasible by reducing launch costs and
optimizing data transmission. The satellite technology incorporates Quantum-Resistant cryptographic keys, and
offers future-proof security against potential quantum computing threats, a step critical to the long-term security of
global IoT ecosystems.

An essential component of WISeSat.Space’s strategy is the creation of a European-based, neutral satellite
constellation. By anchoring operations in Europe, WISeSat.Space is able to ensure data sovereignty and reduce
reliance on non-European providers for critical IoT and environmental data. This independence not only strengthens
data security but also allows for robust, unencumbered international cooperation. A neutral European constellation
addresses global trust concerns, positioning Europe as a leader in secure and autonomous satellite technology.
This approach further aligns with EU objectives for strategic autonomy and technological resilience, fostering
economic growth and high-tech job creation within the region.

The advanced satellite set for January 2025 launch includes key enhancements to bolster connectivity for diverse
IoT applications. The satellites' upgraded semiconductor technology, developed by SEALSQ, optimizes both
processing and communication capabilities. This facilitates faster data relay and enhanced responsiveness, crucial
for applications in real-time environmental monitoring, industrial automation, and smart agriculture. For climate
change monitoring, the WISeSat constellation allows for the real-time tracking of environmental variables, enabling
early detection and response to extreme weather events. The satellites contribute to disaster management through
early warning systems, aiding vulnerable communities and ecosystems by providing timely, high-quality data. These
capabilities not only support critical disaster preparedness but also allow policymakers to make informed decisions
about climate resilience and adaptation.

WISeSat.Space’s picosatellites employ a unique design focused on compactness and cost-effectiveness. Through
the combination of low-orbit satellite networks and low-power, long-range sensors, WISeSat.Space provides a
reliable network with low latency and high data accuracy—ideal for continuous tracking and monitoring across
large, remote areas. These picosatellites are designed to operate with minimal power consumption, which is crucial
for sustainable, long-term deployment in remote locations. Each satellite is embedded with WISeKey’s advanced
cybersecurity protocols, ensuring that data is encrypted and secure from unauthorized access throughout its
journey from sensor to end-user.

The launch’s timing aligns with WISeKey’s annual event in Davos, where industry leaders, policymakers, and
technologists will convene for a roundtable on space technology and its applications in IoT and climate monitoring.
This roundtable will provide a platform to discuss how space-based systems can address global challenges and
explore the role of satellite technology in building a sustainable and secure digital future. With the upcoming launch
of this next-generation satellite, WISeSat.Space reaffirms its commitment to pioneering secure, scalable IoT
solutions and advancing European autonomy in space technology. WISeKey looks forward to this critical addition to
its constellation as it leverages space to enhance secure connectivity, climate resilience, and technological
independence for the global community.
