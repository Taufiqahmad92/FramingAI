R Systems International Limited, a global leader in digital product engineering, today announced the launch of our
groundbreaking Resilience Engineering model, which combines Chaos Engineering with DRaaS. This innovative
approach merges the proactive testing and fault detection of Chaos Engineering with the dependable recovery
mechanisms of DRaaS, equipping businesses with a powerful model to prevent disruptions and ensure seamless
continuity in critical operations.

"Our new Resilience Engineering model is a game-changer for businesses looking to enhance their IT resilience
and disaster recovery capabilities," said Nitesh Bansal, CEO and Managing Director of R Systems. "By combining
the strengths of Chaos Engineering and DRaaS, we are offering a proactive, comprehensive, and scalable
approach to business continuity. This launch underscores our commitment to innovation, helping businesses not
only prepare for disruptions but thrive in the face of them."

Enterprises can now benefit from our holistic approach to IT resilience and disaster preparedness. Our approach,
leveraging the BRACED framework, ensures that IT systems are not just resilient but practically bulletproof. Key
highlights of the model:
    •     Proactive Resilience: Our model anticipates potential failures, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
          before they escalate into critical issues, ensuring systems stay resilient in real-time.
    •     Real-Time Recovery with Near-Zero RTO & RPO: Achieve near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and
          Recovery Point Objective (RPO), minimizing downtime and data loss. Our real-time recovery ensures that
          critical operations and data are swiftly restored, maintaining seamless continuity even in the face of
          unexpected disruptions.
    •     Comprehensive Failure Scenario Coverage: Our Resilience Engineering model prepares for a wide range
          of potential failures, providing robust protection across diverse threat landscapes to safeguard your
          operations.
    •     Automated, Scalable Business Continuity: With automated resilience testing and cloud-based disaster
          recovery, our model ensures your systems remain ready, scalable, and responsive to evolving threats,
          offering a hands-off, future-proof approach to business continuity.

                                                                                             Page 2 of 2
