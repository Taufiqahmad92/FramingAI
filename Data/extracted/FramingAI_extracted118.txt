Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: XEL) today reported 2024 third quarter GAAP earnings of $682 million, or $1.21 per
share, compared with $656 million, or $1.19 per share in the same period in 2023 and ongoing earnings of $707
million, or $1.25 compared with $682 million, or $1.23 per share in the same period in 2023. See Note 6 for
reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.

Third quarter ongoing earnings reflect recovery of increased infrastructure investments, partially offset by increased
depreciation and interest charges.

"The U.S. energy industry is on the cusp of its biggest transition in a century," said Bob Frenzel, chairman,
president and CEO of Xcel Energy. "The unprecedented energy demand to power new technologies, grow U.S.-
based manufacturing and support the electrification of our daily lives requires a fundamental shift in how our
industry generates and delivers energy, while ensuring our infrastructure is designed to withstand severe weather
events and other risks."

"Today, Xcel Energy introduced its new five-year, $45 billion investment plan. The plan builds on Xcel Energy's
proactive efforts to meet this historic moment to make our grid cleaner, more efficient and more resilient while safely
and affordably meeting the needs of our customers and communities today and for generations to come," added
Frenzel. "As we make these investments, we will continue to work efficiently and cost-effectively across our
company to ensure that we are delivering our energy and services at the lowest possible price."

XCEL ENERGY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)

Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy's operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base
from which to project annual results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE),
ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company's
financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy's management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis,
for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and
communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to
supplement investors' understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial
measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not
be comparable to other companies' similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.

Ongoing ROE

Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for
certain nonrecurring items, by each entity's average stockholder's equity. We use these non-GAAP financial
measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.

Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)

                                                                                                    Page 5 of 25
                                  Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common
stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares
outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.'s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method.
Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for
Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully
diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is
calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted
average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy's core earnings and
underlying performance. For instance, to present ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted earnings per share, we may
adjust the related GAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring in nature. We believe these
measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of
our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to measures
calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Note 1. Earnings Per Share Summary

Xcel Energy's third quarter GAAP earnings were $1.21 per share, compared with $1.19 per share in the same
period in 2023 and ongoing earnings were $1.25 per share in 2024, compared with $1.23 per share in 2023. The
change in earnings per share was primarily driven by increased recovery of infrastructure investments, partially
offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and O&M expenses. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas
revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally
do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues). See Note 6
for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.

Note 2. Regulated Utility Results

Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings - Unusually hot summers or cold winters
increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated
impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural
gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating
expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather
deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy's financial performance. However, electric sales true-up and
gas decoupling mechanism in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather in that
jurisdiction.

Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather
conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on
regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather
impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized
estimates.

Electric Fuel and Purchased Power - Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are impacted by
fluctuations in market prices of natural gas, coal and uranium, as well as seasonality. These incurred expenses are
generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are
largely offset in operating revenues and have minimal earnings impact.

Electric fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $121 million for the third quarter and $465 million year-to-
date. The decrease is primarily due to timing of fuel recovery mechanisms and lower commodity prices.

Cost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported - Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are impacted by
market prices and seasonality. These costs are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery
mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are largely offset in operating revenues and have minimal
earnings impact.

Natural gas sold and transported decreased $7 million for the third quarter and $420 million year-to-date. The
decrease is primarily due to lower commodity prices and volumes.

O&M Expenses - O&M expenses increased $69 million for the third quarter and increased $58 million year-to-date.
The year-to-date increase was primarily due to operational activities (generation maintenance, damage prevention,
storm response and wildfire mitigation) and recognition of previously deferred costs associated with the Texas
Electric Rate Case, partially offset by gain on land sale in the first quarter and lower bad debt expense.

Depreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization increased $63 million for the third quarter and $235
million year-to-date. The year-to-date increase was largely the result of system expansion partially offset by
recognition of previously deferred costs and depreciation rate changes associated with various rate cases.

Interest Charges - Interest charges increased $57 million for the third quarter and $146 million year-to-date, largely
due to increased debt levels and higher interest rates.

Other Income - Other income increased $36 million for the third quarter and $56 million year-to-date. The year-to-
date increase was primarily due to interest earned and rabbi trust performance, which is partially offset in O&M
expenses.

AFUDC, Equity and Debt - AFUDC increased $25 million for the third quarter and $71 million year-to-date, driven by
increased investment in renewable and transmission projects.

Income Taxes - Effective income tax rate:

Credit Ratings - Access to the capital markets at reasonable terms is partially dependent on credit ratings. The
following ratings reflect the views of Moody's, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. The highest credit rating for debt is
Aaa/AAA and the lowest investment grade rating is Baa3/BBB-. The highest rating for commercial paper is P-1/A-
1/F-1 and the lowest rating is P-3/A-3/F-3. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities.
Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating.

The base plan does not include any potential incremental generation or transmission assets that are pending
commission approval through a request for proposal (RFP), a resource plan, or from additional data center load,
which could result in additional capital expenditures of approximately $10 billion or greater. Xcel Energy generally
expects to fund additional capital investment with approximately 40% equity and 60% debt.

Xcel Energy's capital expenditure forecast is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual capital
expenditures may vary from estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, safety and
reliability needs, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, tax policy, reserve requirements, availability of

Note 4. Rates, Regulation and Other

NSP-Minnesota - 2024 Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case -In November 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with
the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $59 million, or
9.6%. The request was based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forward test year with rate base
of approximately $1.27 billion. In December 2023, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota's request for interim rates,
subject to refund, of approximately $51 million (implemented on Jan. 1, 2024).

In June 2024, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed an uncontested settlement, which includes the following
terms:
    •       Natural gas rate increase of $46 million, or 7.5%.
    •       ROE of 9.6%.
    •       Equity ratio of 52.5%.
    •       Rate base of $1.25 billion.
    •       No change to Commission approved decoupling.

In October 2024, an ALJ recommended the MPUC approve the rate case settlement. A MPUC decision and order is
expected in the first quarter of 2025.

NSP-Minnesota - North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case - In December 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with
the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) seeking an increase in natural gas rates of $8.5 million
(9.4%), based on a ROE of 10.20%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, 2024 test year and rate base of $168 million. In
February 2024, the NDPSC approved interim rates of $8 million, effective March 1, 2024.

                                                                                                    Page 17 of 25
                                 Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

In August 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement agreement with NDPSC Staff and AARP. Key terms of the
settlement included an increase in natural gas rates of $7.3 million (8.1%), based on a ROE of 9.9% and an equity
ratio of 52.5%. A NDPSC decision and order is expected by the end of 2024.

NSP-Minnesota - Minnesota 2023 Fuel Clause Adjustment - In March 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed its annual fuel
clause adjustment true-up petition to the MPUC.

In 2024, the DOC recommended customer refunds for 2023 replacement power costs incurred during an outage at
the Prairie Island generating station (October 2023 through February 2024). NSP-Minnesota estimates that
customer refunds would be approximately $22 million if the DOC recommendations are applied to both 2023 and
2024.

In September 2024, the MPUC ruled NSP-Minnesota was imprudent in the operation of the Prairie Island nuclear
plant based on an incident that resulted in the extended outage. The MPUC declined to quantify the refund and
referred the determination of the refund amount to the Office of Administrative Hearings. A procedural schedule will
be determined in the fourth quarter of 2024. NSP-Minnesota has recorded an estimated liability for a customer
refund.

NSP-Minnesota - Sherco Unit 3 - In May 2024, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended a customer
refund of $34 million (less a portion of the proceeds received from the settlement with GE) related to purchase
power costs incurred during a Sherco Unit 3 outage that started in 2011. The ALJ indicated that consideration of the
$22 million of previously disallowed costs was not in the scope of their recommendation. In October 2024, the
MPUC ordered customer refunds of $46 million, which is presented as a non-recurring charge to electric revenues
in the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024.

NSP-Minnesota - 2024 Minnesota Resource Plan Settlement - In February 2024, NSP filed its Upper Midwest
Resource Plan with the MPUC. In October 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement with several parties reaching
agreement on the resource plan, as well as the proposed projects to be approved in the pending 800 MW firm
dispatchable resource acquisition.

NSP-Minnesota anticipates a MPUC decision in 2025 and will file related a RFP for remaining resource needs upon
approval. The settlement included the following key items:
    •   The selection of the company-owned 420 MW Lyon County combustion turbine.
    •   The selection of the company-owned 300 MW 4-hour Sherco battery energy storage system.
    •   Multiple PPAs to proceed to the negotiation stage.
    •   The addition of 3,200 MW of wind, 400 MW of solar and 600 MW of stand-alone storage to be added
        through 2030 based on an RFP process. Approximately 2,800 MW of wind resources are projected to
        utilize the Minnesota Energy Connection transmission line.
    •   Planned life extensions of the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants through the early 2050s.

NSP-Minnesota - 2024 Electric Rate Case - In early November 2024, NSP-Minnesota plans to file an electric rate
case in Minnesota, seeking a total revenue increase of $491 million (13.2%) over two years, based on an ROE of
10.3%, a 52.5% equity ratio and rate base of $13.2 billion in 2025 and $14 billion in 2026. NSP-Minnesota will also
request interim rates of $224 million to go into effect in January 2025. A decision is expected in 2026.

NSP-Wisconsin - Wisconsin 2025 Stay-Out Proposal - In June 2024, NSP-Wisconsin filed a 2025 stay-out proposal
with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). The filing proposes to offset 2025 revenue deficiencies
of $28 million for electric and $3 million for natural gas by amortizing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) deferrals,
stopping a deferral related to IRA benefits ordered in a previous rate case, and deferring revenue requirement
impacts of two natural gas capital projects. NSP-Wisconsin expects to have a PSCW decision by year-end 2024.

                                                                                                   Page 18 of 25

PSCo - Colorado Natural Gas Rate Case -In January 2024, PSCo, filed a request with the CPUC seeking an
increase to retail natural gas rates of $171 million (9.5%). The request was based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio
of 55%, a 2023 test year and a $4.2 billion year-end rate base.

In October 2024, the CPUC issued an order including the following key decisions:
    •    Use of a historic 2023 test year, with a 13-month average rate base.
    •    Weighted-average cost of capital of 7.0%, based on an ROE range of 9.2%-9.5% and an equity ratio range
         of 52%-55%.
    •    Acceleration of $15 million per year of depreciation expense (incremental to PSCo's original rate request),
         to be held in an external trust for future decommissioning costs.
    •    Modifications to recoverability of certain operating expenses.
    •    Denial of PSCo's decoupling proposal.

Based on the CPUC order, PSCo estimates an annual revenue increase of approximately $130 million, inclusive of
$15 million of accelerated depreciation, with rates expected to be effective Nov. 5, 2024.

PSCo - 2024 Colorado Electric Resource Plan - In October, 2024, PSCo filed its electric resource plan, known as
the Just Transition Solicitation, with the CPUC. The filing reflects the expected growth on the system, the
generation resources needed to meet the projected growth and the future evaluation of competitive bids for new
generation resources.
    •    The plan reflects a base sales forecast with 7% compound annual sales growth through 2031.
    •    The plan also presents a low sales forecast with a 3% compound annual sales growth through 2031.
    •    The resource plan includes forecasted need of 5-14 GW of new generation capacity through 2031,
         including renewables and firm dispatchable resources to meet the two different scenarios. The acquisitions
         of generation resources will be determined through a competitive solicitation after the CPUC determines
         the portfolio. The table below summarizes two of the proposed portfolios based on the different sales
         scenarios:
        (Megawatts)                                                       Base Plan        Low Load

A CPUC decision on the resource plan is expected by the fall of 2025 (Phase I) with the competitive solicitation for
resource additions expected in early 2026.

PSCo - Wildfire Mitigation Plan -In June 2024, PSCo filed an Updated Wildfire Mitigation Plan (the WMP) and
request for recovery of costs covering the years 2025 to 2027 with the CPUC. The estimated total cost for this plan
is approximately $1.9 billion. A CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2025.

The WMP is a key component of keeping our customers and communities safe while providing reliable and
affordable electric service. The WMP integrates industry experience; incorporates evolving risk assessment
methodologies; adds new technology; and expands the scope, pace and scale of our work to reduce wildfire risk in
a comprehensive and efficient manner under four core programs that include the following:
    •    Situational awareness - Meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and
         continuous monitoring.
    •    Operational mitigations - Enhanced powerline safety settings and public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).

                                                                                                    Page 19 of 25

    •    System resiliency - Asset assessment and remediations, pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted
         undergrounding and vegetation management.
    •    Customer support - Coordination and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders and
         PSPS resiliency rebates.

The procedural schedule is as follows:
    •    Answer testimony: Feb. 14, 2025
    •    Rebuttal testimony: March 21, 2025
    •    Settlement deadline: April 11, 2025
    •    Hearing: May 5-15, 2025
    •    Decision deadline: Aug. 28, 2025

PSCo - Excess Liability Insurance Deferral - In August 2024, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC to establish a
tracker to defer differences in excess liability insurance premiums after the October 2024 policy renewal (reflecting
significantly rising premiums, largely associated with wildfire risks throughout the United States) and amounts
currently recovered. In October 2024, the CPUC approved an accelerated procedural schedule which is as follows:
    •    Rebuttal testimony: Nov. 1, 2024
    •    Settlement deadline: Nov. 12, 2024
    •    Hearing: Nov. 21, 2024
    •    Target decision date: Dec. 31, 2024

SPS - New Mexico Resource Plan (IRP) - In October 2023, SPS filed its IRP with the New Mexico Public
Regulation Commission (NMPRC), which supports projected load growth and increasing reliability requirements,
and secures replacement energy and capacity for retiring resources. SPS' projected resource needs ranging from
approximately 5,300 MW to 10,200 MW by 2030. In February 2024, the NMPRC accepted the IRP.

In July 2024, SPS issued a RFP, seeking approximately 3,200 MW of accredited generation capacity by 2030. The
total capacity to be added to the system is expected to align with the range identified in the SPS IRP, depending on
the types of resources proposed in the RFP and their accredited capacity factors.

The RFP will be evaluated in the first quarter of 2025. SPS is expected to file for a certificate of need for the
recommended portfolio in the summer of 2025. The Texas and New Mexico Commissions are expected to rule on
the portfolio in 2026.

Note 5. Wildfire Litigation

2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex - On February 26, 2024, multiple wildfires began in the Texas Panhandle,
including the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire, which burned into the perimeter of the
Smokehouse Creek Fire (together, referred to herein as the "Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex"). The Texas A&M
Forest Service issued incident reports that determined that the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire
were caused by power lines owned by SPS after wooden poles near each fire origin failed. According to the Texas
A&M Forest Service's Incident Viewer and news reports, the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex burned
approximately 1,055,000 acres.

SPS is aware of approximately 23 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Services Inc. as an
additional defendant, relating to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex, including one putative class action on behalf
of persons or entities who owned rangelands or pastures that were damaged by the fire. The complaints generally
allege that SPS' equipment ignited the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and seek compensation for losses
resulting from the fire, asserting various causes of action under Texas law. In addition to seeking compensatory
damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages. SPS has also received approximately 179

                                                                                                        Page 20 of 25
                                   Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

claims for losses related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex through its claims process and has reached final
settlements on 86 of those claims. In addition to filed complaints and claims made through SPS' claims process,
SPS has also received information from attorneys for claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex which
have not been submitted through the claims process and have also not been filed as lawsuits. SPS anticipates
additional complaints and demands will be made. In July 2024, SPS reached a settlement of a complaint related to
one of the two fatalities believed to be associated with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex.

Texas law does not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company's liability for fire-related damages.
For negligence claims under Texas law, a public utility has a duty to exercise ordinary and reasonable care.

Potential liabilities related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex depend on various factors, including the cause
of the equipment failure and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, including damages to residential and
commercial structures, personal property, vegetation, livestock and livestock feed (including replacement feed),
personal injuries and any other damages, penalties, fines or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other
governmental entities if SPS is found to have been negligent.

Based on the current state of the law and the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this filing, Xcel
Energy believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and
accordingly has accrued a $215 million estimated loss for the matter (before available insurance), presented in
other current liabilities as of Sept. 30, 2024.

The aggregate liability of $215 million for claims in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex (before
available insurance) corresponds to the lower end of the range of Xcel Energy's reasonably estimable range of
losses, and is subject to change based on additional information. This $215 million estimate does not include,
among other things, amounts for (i) potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on
Xcel Energy, (ii) exemplary or punitive damages, (iii) compensation claims by federal, state, county and local
government entities or agencies, (iv) compensation claims for damage to trees, railroad lines, or oil and gas
equipment, or (v) other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.

Xcel Energy remains unable to reasonably estimate any additional loss or the upper end of the range because there
are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. In the
event that SPS or Xcel Energy Services Inc. was found liable related to the litigation related to the Smokehouse
Creek Fire Complex and was required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of
approximately $500 million for the annual policy period and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The process for estimating losses associated with potential claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex
requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors,
including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience
with wildfires. As more information becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the
potential financial impact of the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex may change.

SPS records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery will occur, and SPS can reasonably
estimate the amount or range. SPS has recorded an insurance receivable for $215 million, presented within
prepayments and other current assets as of Sept. 30, 2024. While SPS plans to seek recovery of all insured losses,
it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.

Marshall Wildfire Litigation -In December 2021, a wildfire ignited in Boulder County, Colorado (Marshall Fire), which
burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County
Sheriff's Office released its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary and Review and its supporting documents
(Sheriff's Report). According to an October 2022 statement from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, the
Marshall Fire is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion in property losses.

According to the Sheriff's Report, on Dec. 30, 2021, a fire ignited on a residential property in Boulder, Colorado,
located in PSCo's service territory, for reasons unrelated to PSCo's power lines. According to the Sheriff's Report,

                                                                                                         Page 21 of 25
                                   Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

approximately one hour and 20 minutes after the first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa
Trailhead in unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo's service territory. According to the
Sheriff's Report, the second ignition started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo's power lines in the area.

The Sheriff's Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from
PSCo's power lines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it
cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff's
Report, no design, installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo's electrical circuit in
the area of the second ignition. PSCo disputes that its power lines caused the second ignition.

PSCo is aware of 307 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Inc. and Xcel Energy Services Inc.
as additional defendants, relating to the Marshall Fire. The complaints are on behalf of at least 4,087 plaintiffs. The
complaints generally allege that PSCo's equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various causes of action
under Colorado law, including negligence, premises liability, trespass, nuisance, wrongful death, willful and wanton
conduct, negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium and inverse condemnation. In addition to
seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages.

In September 2023, the Boulder County District Court Judge consolidated the pending lawsuits into a single action
for pretrial purposes and has subsequently consolidated additional lawsuits that have been filed. At the case
management conference in February 2024, a trial date was set for September 2025. Discovery is now underway.

In September 2024, the Judge presiding over the consolidated cases in Boulder County issued an order regarding
the trial that resolves, on a preliminary basis, certain disputes over the structure of the September 2025 trial. The
Court ruled that all Plaintiffs should be bound by a trial on liability unless they opt-out with good cause. The Court
also ruled that liability and damages should be largely or entirely tried separately, meaning that common questions
of law and fact regarding liability would be decided first, and a majority or all of the damages phase will occur
separately following the liability phase of trial. The individual plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the opt-
out portion of this order, which is currently before the Court.

Colorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company's liability for fire-related
damages. For inverse condemnation claims, Colorado courts assess whether a defendant acted with intent to take
a plaintiff's property or intentionally took an action which has the natural consequence of taking the property. For
negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a
heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to
occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated.

Colorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is
liable for the degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the
defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury's verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous. Under
Colorado law, in a civil action filed before Jan. 1, 2025, other than a medical malpractice action, the total award for
noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million per defendant unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount
by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the maximum doubles.

Colorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages
awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three
times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the
pendency of the case or the defendant has acted in a willful and wanton manner during the action which further
aggravated plaintiff's damages.

In the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages,
such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of
the fire and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo are unable to estimate the
amount or range of possible losses in connection with the Marshall Fire.

                                  Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

Note 6. Non-GAAP Reconciliation

Xcel Energy's reported earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy's management believes that
ongoing earnings, or GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items, reflect management's performance in operating the
company and provides a meaningful representation of the underlying performance of Xcel Energy's core business.
In addition, Xcel Energy's management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for
reporting of results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and
investors. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and
reported in accordance with GAAP.

Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings)

The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (net income) to ongoing earnings:

Sherco Unit 3 2011 Outage Refunds - NSP-Minnesota's Sherco Unit 3 experienced an extended outage following a
2011 incident which damaged its turbine. In October 2024 following contested case procedures, the MPUC ordered
a customer refund of $46 million for replacement power incurred during the outage. See Note 4.

Comanche Unit 3 Litigation - In the third quarter of 2023, PSCo recognized a non-recurring $34 million charge
(excluded from on-going earnings) as a result of a jury verdict in Denver County District Court awarding CORE
Electric Cooperative lost power damages and other costs.

Note 7. Earnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives

Xcel Energy 2024 Earnings Guidance -Xcel Energy's 2024 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.50 to $3.60
per share.(a)

Key assumptions as compared with 2023 actual levels unless noted:

        of incremental insurance costs associated with wildfire risk.
    •   Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.
    •   Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~1%.
    •   Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to decline by ~1%.

    •   O&M expenses are projected to increase 3% to 4%.

                                                                                                            Page 23 of 25
                                  Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Report

   •    Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $290 million to $300 million.
   •    Property taxes are expected to decline $10 to $20 million.
   •    Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest
        income.
   •    AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $70 million to $80 million.

Xcel Energy 2025 Earnings Guidance -Xcel Energy's 2025 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.75 to $3.85
per share.(a)

Key assumptions as compared with 2024 projected levels unless noted:
   •    Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings, including requests for deferral
        of incremental insurance costs associated with wildfire risk and recovery of O&M costs associated with
        wildfire mitigation plans.
   •    Normal weather patterns for the year.
   •    Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~3%.
   •    Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to increase ~1%.
   •    Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $240 million to $250 million (net of PTCs).
   •    O&M expenses are projected to increase ~3%.
   •    Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $210 million to $220 million.
   •    Property taxes are projected to increase $40 million to $50 million.
   •    Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest
        income.
   •    AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $120 million to $130 million.
        (   Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items
        a   that are, in management's view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing earnings could differ from
        )   those prepared in accordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. As Xcel Energy is
            unable to quantify the financial impacts of any additional adjustments that may occur for the year, we are
            unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP
            EPS.

Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives -Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to
our shareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term
objectives:
   •    Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 6% to 8% based off of $3.55 per share (the mid-point of 2024
        original ongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share).
   •    Deliver annual dividend increases of 4% to 6%.
   •    Target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60%.
   •    Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.
