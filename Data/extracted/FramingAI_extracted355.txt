The following information was released by The Rockefeller Foundation:

With the general debate of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly underway, The Rockefeller
Foundation announced that it will be hosting AsiaXchange 2024 next week (October 1-3, 2024) in Bangkok,
Thailand. With the theme, Accelerating Asia's Equitable Green Transformation: Taking a Systems Approach for
Climate Action, the event aims to explore how countries, businesses, and communities can come together to build a
sustainable, low-carbon future for the region. AsiaXchange 2024 will feature practical discussions on harnessing a
systems approach, driven by synergies between individuals, communities, governments, the private sector, and
financiers, to foster a green and resilient Asia.

Asia is at the center of global climate action, said Deepali Khanna, Vice President of the Asia Regional Office at
The Rockefeller Foundation. With AsiaXchange 2024, we're bringing together Asian financiers, policymakers,
solutions providers, and leaders of frontline communities to share ideas, form partnerships, and find the solutions
we need to secure a green, resilient future for all.

AsiaXchange 2024 also comes at a key moment as the region prepares for COP29, where Asia's climate agenda
will take center stage. This year's AsiaXchange event will explore how Asia can lead the charge with innovative
solutions and partnerships to meet its climate commitments. Speakers and attendees from across Asia and the
world will address key issues such as: How can we unite to create momentum for Asia's equitable green
transformation? How can we drive climate efforts anchored in a people-first approach and systemic collaboration?
How can we mobilize domestic, regional, and international finance that works for Asia?

"Asia can demonstrate to the rest of the world how to achieve development with sustainability," said Elizabeth Yee,
Executive Vice President for Programs at The Rockefeller Foundation. "AsiaXchange 2024 will help us strengthen
partnerships capable of scaling practical, people-centered climate solutions across the region."

Key speakers at AsiaXchange 2024 will include Albert Park, Chief Economist at the Asian Development Bank;
Beverley Postma, Executive Director at Grow Asia; Dr. Phirun Saiyasitpanich, Director General of Climate Change

Billions and Trillions: Closing the Climate Finance Gap: With an annual shortfall of $800 billion in climate financing
for Asia, this session will dive into how the region can mobilize both public and private capital to close the gap.
Experts will discuss innovative financial structures like green bonds, catalytic capital, and the role of development
banks in bridging the finance gap.

Multiplying Inclusive and Sustainable Business Models: This session explores how inclusive business models
contribute to Asia's green transformation, with discussions on scaling green businesses and promoting

opportunities and challenges in using AI for sustainable development.

The 2023 AsiaXchange kicked off in New Delhi, India, where over 150 global leaders gathered to discuss The
Rockefeller Foundation's new climate strategy. The event focused on identifying key opportunities for climate action
