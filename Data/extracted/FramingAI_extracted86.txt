ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConnectWise, the leading software company dedicated
to the success of Managed Service Providers (MSPs), today at IT Nation Connect 2024 announced that
ConnectWise PSA™, a groundbreaking initiative that delivers a reimagined, modern professional services
automation (PSA) experience, is now in the Asio Platform™. This brings a unified user interface (UI) and user
experience (UX) to ConnectWise PSA, reducing the time spent moving between solutions and making issue
resolution faster and easier. By leveraging shared platform services, ConnectWise PSA now provides increased
efficiencies, ultimately decreasing costs for MSPs.

Asio is the only platform purpose-built for MSPs. It has one unified UX, common services, and centralized data for
all ConnectWise applications with generative AI and robotic process automation (RPA), driving unparalleled
productivity and scale. The platform provides a one-stop-shop solution for partners with innovative products like
ConnectWise RMM™, ConnectWise Security360™, ConnectWise Backup360, and now ConnectWise PSA.
Sidekick, the company’s AI solution, provides visibility across all solutions, offers predictive insights, and proactively
suggests solutions and auto remediations.

Working in disparate, disconnected systems can significantly impact the efficiency of a business, potentially costing
over 25% of yearly revenue. With ConnectWise PSA in the Asio platform, MSPs can eliminate double data entry
and utilize one system to streamline processes and improve overall efficiency. Manual tasks can be automated,
reducing business costs and eliminating unnecessary overhead. The modern ConnectWise PSA empowers teams
to accomplish more with less, ensuring service level agreements (SLAs) are met and billable time and products are
accurately invoiced.

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 2

The company’s vision is to have PSA, Remote Monitoring and Management, Business Intelligence, Managed
Detection and Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, and more – all unified on a single
platform. With RMM and PSA now in the Asio platform, ConnectWise is enabling partners to unlock cross-platform
AI capabilities, hyperautomation, and insights that are otherwise impossible when patching together disparate point
