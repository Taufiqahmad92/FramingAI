INCREASING USE OF SATELLITE IMAGING IN AGRICULTURE & FORESTRY SUPPORTING MARKET
GROWTHThe integration of satellite imaging into agricultural and forestry practices enhances productivity and
promotes more sustainable and environmentally conscious approaches within these sectors. In agriculture, satellite
imagery offers critical insights into crop health and growth, enabling farmers to identify potential issues early, such
as nutrient deficiencies or crop diseases, and take corrective actions. This technology supports precision agriculture
at scale, even in regions with frequent cloud cover, by facilitating targeted interventions that lead to improved yields
and resource management. Additionally, satellite imagery aids in tracking weather patterns across large areas,
empowering farmers to make informed decisions about planting and harvesting while better preparing for weather-
related risks such as floods or droughts.In forestry, satellite imaging enables forest managers and timber operators
to optimize management practices, ensuring productivity while maintaining environmental stewardship and
compliance with land use regulations. This technology allows for visibility through dense smoke from wildfires to
locate flames and hot spots. It also helps identify wildlife hotspots and map species movements, enhancing the
understanding of connectivity within their changing territories across borders. Additionally, satellite imaging assists
in tracking and identifying illegal deforestation, assessing forest health, monitoring changes in land cover, and
improving overall forest management practices.Some of the key recent developments in this space are as
follows:In July 2024, Axelspace Corporation (Japan) partnered with the Maldives Space Research Organization

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4

(MSRO) to deliver satellite imagery covering the entire Maldives, which comprises 1,192 islands across 871
kilometers. The imagery, sourced from GRUS satellites equipped with red-edge spectral bands, will facilitate
detailed observation and analysis of vegetation health. This initiative aims to assist the MSRO in supporting the
current government's efforts to enhance food security by improving the monitoring of farmland, crop health, and
biodiversity.In January 2024, EOS Data Analytics, Inc. (U.S.) successfully launched EOS SAT-1, the first satellite in
the EOS SAT constellation focused on agriculture, into low Earth orbit using SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Cape
Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This constellation will support the implementation of sustainable
agricultural practices and environmental monitoring of forestlands by providing high-quality data for analysis.
Additionally, it will assist agribusinesses in monitoring crop growth and detecting issues such as heat stress, cold
stress, water stress, weed spread, pest attacks, and other threats to crops.These factors, along with the increasing
use of satellite imaging to identify trends, plan resource allocation effectively, and mitigate risks associated with
environmental changes, are supporting the growth of the satellite imaging market.Satellite Imaging Market
