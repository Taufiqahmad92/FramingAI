PR NewswireIntegration with Microsoft Graph Connector Enables Greater Productivity with Enhanced AI-Powered
Search, Compliance, and Analytics Capabilities for Unstructured Data at ScaleBOSTON, Sept. 24, 2024
/PRNewswire/ --Nasuni, a leading enterprise data platform for hybrid cloud environments, today announced its
latest advancement in data intelligence by further integrating with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Through the Microsoft
Graph Connector, Nasuni managed data is now fully accessible and operational with Microsoft Search and
Microsoft 365 Copilot, significantly expanding data access for Microsoft's AI services.

 AI requires AI-ready infrastructure, and today's legacy data storage infrastructure creates a challenge for forward-
thinking enterprises. Legacy hardware-based storage generates silos of data, making it impossible to run AI and
analytics against it. Organizations, which can have billions of files and petabytes of data, need to break down these
silos and consolidate their data into the cloud. The power to unlock this data is incredible, which is why the Nasuni
File Data Platform enables this through data consolidation, protection, and accessibility for anyone and anything
(including AI).The Graph Connector enables organizations to leverage Nasuni's managed data repositories to
harness the full potential of Microsoft 365 Copilot, aligning AI-powered experiences with specific business needs
and workflows. Organizations can use the Graph Connector to leverage Nasuni data with Microsoft 365 semantic
index to unlock AI-powered search, enhanced compliance, and advanced analytics through a unified interface.Key
benefits of this integration include:Unlocking Greater Value from Data: Customers can now maximize the value of
their Nasuni managed data by making it accessible for personalized experiences via Microsoft 365 Copilot and
Microsoft Search, enriching user interactions with relevant content.AI-Powered Search and Insights: The Graph
Connector enables Nasuni managed files to be indexed into Microsoft's semantic index, which forms a key part of
the Microsoft 365 AI infrastructure. This semantic index is utilized by Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search to
provide contextually relevant answers and insights across Microsoft 365 applications.A Unified Data Interface:
Customers benefit from single-pane-of-glass access to their Microsoft 365 data (including SharePoint and
OneDrive) and Nasuni. This unified view allows for efficient searching and interaction with documents across the
entire unstructured file stack, inclusive of Nasuni-managed data."By enabling Microsoft 365 Copilot through the use
of the Microsoft Graph Connector, we're empowering our customers to get even more value out of their Nasuni
managed data," said Jim Liddle, Chief Innovation Officer of Data Intelligence and AI at Nasuni. "This solution
integration will make it frictionless to use Microsoft 365 Copilot with Nasuni data in context with Microsoft 365 stored
data sets, allowing for more informed decision-making and improved efficiency in our customers' day-to-day
operations.""We are thrilled to see Nasuni build upon their rich history of Microsoft innovation and collaboration by
