SINGAPORE, Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SAIHEAT Limited (f/k/a SAI.TECH Global Corporation)
(“SAIHEAT” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: SAIH, SAITW), is pleased to announce the integration of HEATNUC, an
advanced Small Modular Reactor (SMR) system dedicated to power AI computing centers. Designed as a stable,
high-capacity energy source, HEATNUC addresses the unique power needs of AI-driven infrastructure, providing a
solution that traditional renewable and fossil-fuel-based energy sources cannot match.

HEATNUC brings together inherent safety, simplified system design, and minimized on-shift manpower
requirements, making it an ideal solution for AI centers that demand steady, high-density, clean power. The
reactor’s modular, integrated design enables rapid deployment, leveraging nuclear power’s consistent output
alongside innovative technology to lower both the time and cost required for licensing and V&V. Through closed-
loop recycling of waste heat from nuclear and AI computing, HEATNUC enhances energy efficiency and supports
deployment in remote, harsh environments, from deserts to arctic regions.

SAIHEAT has crafted HEATNUC to be highly cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable, meeting the long-term power
needs of AI computing centers with ease. This comprehensive solution includes a SMR-based base-load energy
source, an AI campus microgrid, and an intelligent energy management system, all designed to enable zero-
carbon, intelligent operations for AI facilities.

Key Advantages of HEATNUC for AI Computing Centers
    •     Environmental Compliance: Zero emissions, zero pollution, and full carbon-neutral operations.

                                                                                            Page 2 of 3

    •   Efficient Construction: Prefabricated, modular, and plug-and-play design allows easy installation and
        decommissioning.
    •   Low-Operational Demands: With intelligent monitoring and diagnostic systems, HEATNUC operates
        efficiently with minimal staffing needs, enhancing safety through proactive accident prevention.
    •   Sustainable Energy Recycling: HEATNUC harnesses nuclear energy, combined with recovered waste heat
        and storage solutions, to maximize energy utilization.
    •   Cost Reduction: Shortened verification and licensing periods, reduced construction cycles, and minimized
        operational costs contribute to significant savings.
    •   Open Source: SAIHEAT aims to connect SMR technology with the computing sector by providing open-
        source designs and resources to reduce the total cost of electricity for data centers while promoting the
        widespread adoption of clean energy solutions.

HEATNUC’s deployment will empower AI computing centers worldwide to meet increasing energy demands
sustainably. Its compatibility with remote and challenging environments makes it viable in all regions outside
extreme natural disaster zones, such as earthquake or tsunami-prone areas. This technology promises to
revolutionize AI energy strategies, supporting global zero-carbon and intelligent energy goals.

About HEATNUC

HEATNUC is the power module of SAIHEAT dedicated to developing Gen. III+ PWR and Gen. IV SFR and HTGR
for AI centers energy solution. Equipped with self-driven accident prevention mechanisms and an intelligent
defence-in-depth safety approach, HEATNUC’s design outperforms conventional SMR models. The reactor’s
proprietary decay heat-driven passive safety system reduces the probability of reactor degradation events by an
order of magnitude, making it one of the safest SMR options available. HEATNUC positions SAIHEAT at the
forefront of AI-supportive infrastructure.

About SAIHEAT
