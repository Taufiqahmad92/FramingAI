PR NewswireVANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Flowfinity,a leading process management platform
for workflow automationand data visualization, has made significant data center infrastructure investments to
ensure future processing capacity as AI adoption increases.Flowfinity operates a pair of redundant data centers on
its own network, including links between the two, located in and managed from Canada to host cloud systems for
their customers. One is in Toronto, Ontario, and the other in Vancouver, BC.The distance of over 2000 miles
between these two locations is ideal for disaster resilience as each data center is self-sufficient with multiple
degrees of built-in redundancies.

Together, these two data centers allow Flowfinity to provide uninterrupted service to their customers during a
localized power outage, equipment failure, or other unforeseen event.In a significant move to support their clients
current and future processing requirements as they incorporate AI capabilities into their business processes,
Flowfinity has undertaken a substantial expansion and upgrade of its Toronto data center as part of their ongoing
commitment to enhancing service capabilities.Upgrades include doubling their physical footprint and power
allocation, laying new fiber cables, upgrading server capacity, and expanding network redundancy to ensure
continuous service and AI readiness for any future project or deployment."We're excited to make these material
infrastructure investments to support our client's current and future processing requirements as they incorporate AI
into their business processes," said Larry Wilson, Vice President. "With these improvements, we're ensuring optimal
capacity for AI readiness while increasing our protection against system outages through redundancy and disaster
resilience."Following several research projects conducted in the Flowfinity AI lab, they have deployed new clusters
of Nvidia accelerators in their newly expanded Toronto data center to support upcoming AI-power capabilities in
Flowfinity products. Flowfinity's data centers are well prepared to accommodate increasing customer demand for AI
technology.By deploying self-managed AI accelerators, Flowfinity can continue to offer customers encapsulated
cloud services where client data sovereignty is preserved and managed predictably. This is their commitment as AI
capabilities are incorporated into future versions of Flowfinity products.About FlowfinityCelebrating 25
