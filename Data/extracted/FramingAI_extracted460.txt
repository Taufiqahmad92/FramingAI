full scope of the disaster. In addition, by using the latest in AI and machine learning, Vexcel provides a damage
assessment of every property in the Gray Sky collection area that includes an overall CAT score, roof damage
score, and more.Windward Risk Managers will use this detailed aerial imagery and property-level damage

customers have been impacted and at what level, and more accurately estimate the overall loss. By streamlining
claims operations and prioritizing resources, Windward can accelerate claims closure, enabling policyholders to
