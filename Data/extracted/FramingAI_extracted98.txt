Body

American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2024.

AIG Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: "AIG delivered excellent third quarter financial results
with strong profitability and growth across our businesses highlighting the quality of the underwriting portfolio and
our ability to deliver consistent earnings. The adjusted after-tax income per diluted share was $1.23 for the third
quarter, an 18% increase year-over-year, or 31% on a comparable basis. These results demonstrate AIG's ability to
consistently deliver underwriting excellence and capital management discipline and the successful execution of our
priorities.

"We continued to execute on our capital commitments with repurchases of $1.5 billion of common shares and
dividends of $254 million in the third quarter. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have returned over $6
billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting our disciplined execution of our balanced capital management plan. We
ended the quarter with an excellent total debt to capital ratio of 17.9% and parent liquidity of $4.2 billion.

"We achieved meaningful growth this quarter, led by our Global Commercial business. Third quarter net premiums
written grew 6% year-over-year on a comparable basis, driven by 7% growth in Global Commercial Lines, which
maintained very strong retention of 88% while adding $1.1 billion of new business. North America Commercial
Lines achieved 11% growth with new business growth of 22%, led by Lexington Insurance which grew 24%. Global
Commercial Lines pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased 6% excluding Workers' Compensation and
Financial Lines, largely in line with loss cost trend.

"We marked another quarter of excellent underwriting results, building on top of outstanding performance over the
past few years. The third quarter accident year combined ratio, as adjusted was 88.3%, demonstrating our
underwriting discipline. The total catastrophe-related charges were $417 million for the quarter, representing 6.9
loss ratio points, and 4.9 points for the first nine months of the year. In a challenging catastrophe environment, this
performance is remarkable, with industry insured losses expected to top the 2023 total of $125 billion.

"Through 2024 and beyond, we remain incredibly focused on underwriting excellence and executing on AIG Next.
We have made substantial progress over the last several years to improve the financial strength of AIG. I want to
thank our clients, partners and stakeholders for their trust in us, which is a direct result of the outstanding risk
expertise and claims services provided by our dedicated colleagues."

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 23

                                     AIG Reports Excellent Third Quarter 2024 Results

For the third quarter of 2024, net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $459 million, or $0.71 per
diluted common share, compared to $2.0 billion, or $2.81 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The
decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in net income from discontinued operations as a result of the
change in accounting following the deconsolidation of Corebridge, as described below.

AATI was $798 million, or $1.23 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $746 million,
or $1.04 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment income and improved
results in Other Operations, partially offset by loss of earnings due to the Validus Re divestiture and lower
underwriting income in General Insurance.

Total net investment income for the third quarter of 2024 was $973 million, an increase of 14% from $856 million in
the prior year quarter, reflecting dividends received from Corebridge in the third quarter of 2024, higher income on
alternative investments, equity and fixed maturity securities and lower investment expenses, partially offset by lower
income from loans in addition to a reduction in invested assets due to the sale of Validus Re. Total net investment
income on an APTI basis* was $897 million, an increase of 13% from $792 million in the prior year quarter,
reflecting the same trends. In General Insurance, net investment income was up 2% from the prior year quarter,
which included $38 million in net investment income from Validus Re, which was sold on November 1, 2023. On a
comparable basis, General Insurance net investment income was up 8% from the prior year quarter.

In the third quarter of 2024, AIG returned approximately $1.8 billion to AIG shareholders through$1.5 billion of
common stock repurchases representing approximately 20 million shares, and $254 million of common stock
dividends. AIG parent liquidity was $4.2 billion as of September 30, 2024.

Book value per share was $71.46 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.5% from the previous quarter.
Adjusted book value per share* was $73.90, an increase of 1.5% from the previous quarter. Total debt to total
capital ratio at September 30, 2024 was 17.9% and total debt to total adjusted capital* ratio was 17.5%.

On November 4, 2024, the AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on AIG common stock of
$0.40 per share. The dividend is payable on December 30, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business
on December 16, 2024.

Corebridge Financial, Inc. (Corebridge) accounting treatment after June 9, 2024: (i) AIG elected the fair value option
and, after that date, reflects its retained interest in Corebridge as an equity method investment in other invested
assets in AIG's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets using Corebridge's stock price as its fair value, (ii)
dividends received from Corebridge and changes in its stock price are recognized in net investment income in AIG's
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and (iii) AIG's adjusted pre-tax income includes Corebridge
dividends and excludes changes in the fair value of Corebridge's stock price. The historical financial results of
Corebridge, for all periods presented, are reflected in AIG's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as
discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (U.S. GAAP) and are included in net income but not in AATI, a non-GAAP measure.

  •   General Insurance APTI of $1.2 billion decreased 11% from the prior year quarter, largely due to the
      Validus Re divestiture in 2023, or 5% on a comparable basis, driven by lower underwriting income, partially
      offset by higher net investment income.
  •   Third quarter 2024 net premiums written (NPW) of $6.4 billion declined 1% from the prior year quarter on a
      reported basis primarily as a result of the Validus Re divestiture, but increased 6% on a comparable basis,
      driven by 7% growth in Global Commercial and 3% growth in Global Personal Insurance.
  •   Underwriting income was $437 million, a 28% decrease year-over-year including Validus Re, or a 21%
      decrease on a comparable basis, due principally to higher catastrophe charges and lower favorable prior
      year development (PYD), net of reinsurance and prior year premiums.
  •   Total catastrophe-related charges were $417 million, representing 6.9 loss ratio points, of which $324
      million was in North America with losses predominantly from windstorms and hailstorms, and $93 million
      was in International.
  •   Favorable PYD, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums, was $165 million, representing a 2.6 point
      loss ratio benefit. The favorable PYD was largely driven by favorable development on short-tail lines in
      Global Specialty and U.S. Property and Specialty Risks which have performed extremely well and the
      amortization benefit related to adverse development cover. The strong level of favorable development in
      those lines was partially offset by unfavorable development in U.S. Excess Casualty and UK/Europe
      Casualty and Financial Lines.
  •   The combined ratio was 92.6%, compared to 90.2% in the prior year quarter on a comparable basis. The
      AYCR was 88.3%, compared to 86.9% in the prior year quarter on a comparable basis.

  •   North America Commercial Lines NPW declined 4% from the prior year quarter as a result of the 2023
      divestitures, but increased 11% on a comparable basis. The growth was led by Retail Casualty and
      Lexington Insurance, benefiting from robust new business production, which increased 22% year-over-
      year, strong retention and continued positive rate trends.
  •   The combined ratio was 95.5% and the AYCR was 85.1% in the third quarter. On a comparable basis, the
      accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* of 61.8% increased 250 basis points from the prior year quarter. This
      was driven by a large closeout transaction, which benefitted the overall combined ratio but created a 70
      basis point headwind within the loss ratio, as well as a favorable actual vs. expected loss experience in the
      prior year quarter driven by strong property rate increases that resulted in a headwind of approximately 180
      basis points in the year-over-year comparison.

    •   Other Operations adjusted pre-tax loss improved $135 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to
        higher net investment income, lower general operating expenses (GOE) and lower interest expenses.
    •   Net investment income increased $80 million from the prior year quarter due to dividend income received
        from Corebridge in the third quarter of 2024 and higher income on parent short-term investments due to
        higher yields and higher balances.
    •   GOE improved $29 million from the prior year quarter or $40 million sequentially from the second quarter,
        reflecting the benefits from AIG Next.
    •   AIG interest expense decreased $22 million, primarily driven by debt reductions over the last year.

COMMENT ON REGULATION G AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Throughout this press release, including the financial highlights, AIG presents its financial condition and results of
operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of its business results. Some of the
measurements AIG uses are "Non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the
acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures AIG
presents are listed below and may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Regulation G
are included within the relevant tables attached to this news release or in the Third Quarter 2024 Financial
Supplement available in the Investors section of AIG's website, www.aig.com .

Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms "AIG," "we," "us" and "our"
to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.

AIG uses the following operating performance measures because AIG believes they enhance the understanding of
the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG's business segments. AIG believes they also
allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures,
reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.

Book value per share, excluding investments related cumulative unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude
Re funds withheld assets (collectively, Investments AOCI) (Adjusted book value per share) is used to show the
amount of our net worth on a per share basis after eliminating the fair value of investments that can fluctuate
significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. In addition, we adjusted for the cumulative
unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re's
reinsurance obligations to AIG (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are
economically transferred to Fortitude Re. Adjusted book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common
shareholders' equity, excluding Investments AOCI (AIG adjusted common equity) by total common shares
outstanding.

Book Value per share, excluding Goodwill, Value of business acquired (VOBA), Value of distribution channel
acquired (VODA) and Other intangible assets (Tangible book value per share) is used to provide a useful measure
of the realizable shareholder value on a per share basis. Tangible book value per share is derived by dividing Total
AIG common shareholders' equity, excluding intangible assets (AIG tangible common shareholders' equity) by total
common shares outstanding.

Book value per share, excluding Investments AOCI, deferred tax assets (DTA) and AIG's ownership interest in
Corebridge (Core operating book value per share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis
after eliminating Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge. We believe this measure is
useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to changes in market conditions. We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax
attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and corporate alternative minimum tax credits

                                                                                                      Page 10 of 23

(CAMTCs) and foreign tax credits (FTCs) that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates
based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the
DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term
investment for AIG. Core operating book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders'
equity, excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge (AIG core operating
shareholders' equity) by total common shares outstanding.

Total debt and preferred stock to total adjusted capital ratio is used to show the AIG's debt leverage adjusted for
Investments AOCI and is derived by dividing total debt and preferred stock by total capital excluding Investments
AOCI (Total adjusted capital). We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can
fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. In addition, we adjust for the
cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets since these fair value
movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re.

Return on equity - Adjusted after-tax income excluding Investments AOCI (Adjusted return on equity) is used to
show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity excluding Investments AOCI. We believe this measure is
useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments which can fluctuate significantly from period to
period due to changes in market conditions. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim
periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG adjusted
common shareholders' equity.

Return on Equity - Adjusted After-tax Income, Excluding Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other Intangible assets
(Return on tangible equity) is used to show the return on AIG tangible common shareholder's equity, which we
believe is a useful measure of realizable shareholder value. We exclude Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other
intangible assets from AIG common shareholders' equity to derive AIG tangible common shareholders' equity.
Return on AIG tangible common equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted
after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG tangible common equity.

Return on equity - Adjusted after-tax income excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG's ownership interest in
Corebridge (Core operating return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity
excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge. We believe this measure is useful to
investors because it eliminates fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to
changes in market conditions. We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to
NOLs and CAMTCs and FTCs that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on
projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized
is included. We exclude AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG.
This metric will provide greater insight as to the underlying profitability of our property and casualty business. Core
operating return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income
attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG core operating shareholders' equity.

Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included
in Other income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the International reporting lag. Adjusted
revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments.

Adjusted Pre-tax Income (APTI) is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing
operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one
or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or
operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and
measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded
items include the following:
    •   changes in the fair values of equity securities and AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge;
    •   net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;
    •   net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;

                                                                                                     Page 11 of 23
                                 AIG Reports Excellent Third Quarter 2024 Results

    •   loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;
    •   all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement
        accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication.
        Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific
        APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income);
    •   income or loss from discontinued operations;
    •   net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);
    •   pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;
    •   net gain or loss on divestitures and other;
    •   non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;
    •   restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve
        efficiency and simplify our organization;
    •   the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk
        under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;
    •   integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;
    •   losses from the impairment of goodwill;
    •   non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes
        or changes to accounting principles; and
    •   income from elimination of the international reporting lag.

Adjusted After-tax Income attributable to AIG common shareholders (AATI) is derived by excluding the tax effected
APTI adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock and preferred stock redemption premiums,
noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items
from net income attributable to AIG:
    •   deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;
    •   changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our
        current businesses or operating performance; and
    •   net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

See page 15 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to
AIG.

Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and
the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that
describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for
General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would
be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100
indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under
GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The
underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which
affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and
competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and
associated ratios.

Accident year loss and Accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident
year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude
catastrophe losses (CATs) and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium

                                                                                                           Page 12 of 23
                                    AIG Reports Excellent Third Quarter 2024 Results

adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic
events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such
as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are
meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact
of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. We also exclude prior year development to
provide transparency related to current accident year results.

Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:
    •     Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)
    •     Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPE
    •     General operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPE
    •     Expense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratio
    •     Combined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratio
    •     CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred - (CATs)] ÷ [NPE
          +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes] - Loss ratio
    •     Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR ex-CAT) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred -
          CATs - PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums +
          Adjustment for ceded premium under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years]
    •     Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR ex-CAT) = AYLR ex-CAT + Expense ratio
    •     Prior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums ratio = [Loss and loss adjustment
          expenses incurred - CATs - PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior
          year premiums] - Loss ratio - CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio.

Results from discontinued operations, including Corebridge, are excluded from all of these measures.

(      Effective in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the foreign property and casualty subsidiaries report on
b      a calendar year ending December 31. We determined that the effect of not retroactively applying this

       Therefore, we reported the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle within the Consolidated
       Statements of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and did not retrospectively apply the
       effects of this change to prior periods.
