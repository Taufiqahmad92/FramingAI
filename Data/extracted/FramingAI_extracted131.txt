        (CNN) - Does it seem like your phone has been blowing up with political text messages? It's not just you -
these texts have increased substantially in the 2024 election cycle. CNN goes behind the scenes to meet the real
people who send those political texts. And yes, they do see your responses.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.

1. Election countdown

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are trying to reach as many voters as possible
one week from Election Day. Harris is scheduled to deliver the final major address of her campaign today at the
Ellipse - a park just outside the South Lawn of the White House where Trump rallied his supporters ahead of the
January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Trump will be in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he's joining an event in
Drexel Hill and holding a rally in Allentown. This comes as more than 43 million ballots have been cast across 47
states and the District of Columbia. CNN's most recent national poll found that Harris had a large lead among early
voters, despite a virtually tied race overall.

2. Burned ballots

Federal authorities are investigating fires at ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington after hundreds of ballots were
destroyed. Evidence from the incendiary devices found at two charred ballot boxes in the Portland, Oregon, area
shows the fires are connected, as well as a third incident reported in Vancouver, Washington, on October 8, a
spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau said. Authorities are working to determine the motives behind the
attacks that appear "targeted and intentional," the department added. The fires come after the FBI and Department
of Homeland Security recently issued a bulletin raising concerns that "election-related grievances," such as a belief
in voter fraud, could motivate domestic extremists to engage in violence in the weeks before and after the
November election.

3. Flight refunds

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3

US airlines are now required to refund passengers automatically if their flight is significantly delayed or canceled.
The Department of Transportation says the final federal rule requiring that airlines dole out refunds - not vouchers -
went into effect Monday. "Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them - without
headaches or haggling," Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on X. The rule says airlines must refund
passengers affected by significantly changed flights within seven business days if they bought a ticket on a credit
card and within 20 calendar days if they used another form of payment. The move has faced pushback from the
airline industry and is being implemented only a month before the start of what is likely to be a huge holiday travel
season.

4. Middle East

Israel's parliament has banned the UN Palestinian refugee agency despite international outcry. The new laws
prevent UNRWA from operating in the country, a move the UN chief warned could have "devastating
consequences" for millions of Palestinian refugees living in areas under Israel's control. The move follows an
intense Israeli campaign to dismantle UNRWA as the Jewish state's relations with the UN have reached an all-time
low amid the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel previously accused UNRWA staff of taking part in Hamas' October 7
attack, which the agency strongly denied. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon killed dozens of people in
some of the deadliest attacks of the Israel-Hezbollah war, Lebanese officials said.

5. Tropical Storm Trami

Tropical Storm Trami swept across the northeastern Philippines last week, inundating entire towns with severe
flooding and triggering deadly landslides in what was the deadliest and most destructive storm to hit the archipelago
so far this year. Nearly 130 people have been killed and at least 30 are missing, the country's disaster relief
agency said. Authorities are now racing to deliver relief to remote communities, particularly those in the hardest hit
Bicol region, ahead of another powerful storm that could soon lash the region again. The death toll around the
country continues to rise as blocked roads, choppy waters and strong winds make it risky to reach rural areas by
land, sea and air.

THIS JUST IN ...

Steve Bannon released from prisonSteve Bannon, a right-wing podcast host and the chief executive of Donald
Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was released from federal prison today after serving his full 120-day sentence

weakened right-wing media platform in the final days before the presidential election.
