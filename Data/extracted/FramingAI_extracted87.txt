Security Score that highlights risk exposure across the MSP’s client base. This score empowers MSPs to prioritize
their remediation efforts and demonstrate the effectiveness of their security services.

ConnectWise Security360™ is designed to integrate seamlessly with leading security tools, fostering an open

Additionally, ConnectWise Security360™ incorporates ConnectWise Vulnerability Management™ to ensure
continuous and automated scanning of client environments for threats and vulnerabilities. It also comes with
ConnectWise Sidekick™ for Security. This AI-driven digital assistant helps MSPs easily get status on open tickets,
assess security posture for their clients, and respond to threats more efficiently.

ConnectWise Security360™ is built on the ConnectWise Asio™ platform, the only modern, scalable, and secure
cloud-based solution purpose-built for MSPs.

Expanded coverage for ConnectWise MDR™ for Microsoft 365 ConnectWise MDR for Microsoft 365, launched in
June 2024, addresses a common blind spot for MSPs by monitoring, protecting, and remediating threats within
Microsoft Office 365 environments. The latest enhancements have expanded the service to include support beyond
Microsoft Defender for Office 365, now covering Microsoft Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Apps. This solution is offered as a standalone service or can be bundled with the award-winning ConnectWise MDR

ConnectWise Co-Managed Backup™ Enhancements ConnectWise Co-Managed Backup streamlines third-party
data protection solutions through the ConnectWise Asio platform. Supported by the company’s Network Operations
Center (NOC) team, it can reduce technician workload by up to 90%. The latest update enables any partner,
including those using ConnectWise Automate™ and ConnectWise Security solutions, to co-manage backup
solutions through the Asio platform. In addition, MSPs can now use DR (Disaster Recovery) Runbooks within the
platform to automate disaster recovery testing, further enhancing client protection.

ConnectWise Backup360™ Launch ConnectWise is now evolving its Backup Monitoring and Management solution,
which was initially launched in Fall 2023 as ConnectWise Backup360™, enabling MSPs to consolidate and
standardize data protection tools from different backup vendors, whether it be endpoint, cloud, or SaaS backup, into
a unified 360-degree view. This ensures partners can monitor, manage, and take action if they detect backup
failures. ConnectWise Backup360™ supports vendors like Acronis, Axcient, Veeam, and ConnectWise SaaS
Backup, and with the latest update, Datto and SkyKick Cloud Backup—with many more integrations to come.
