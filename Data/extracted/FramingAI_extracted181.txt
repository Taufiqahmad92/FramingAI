The highly anticipated ITU Kaleidoscope 2024 academic conference commenced today at Bharat Mandapam in
New Delhi, India, running parallel to the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly 2024 (WTSA-24).
This years theme, "Innovation and Digital Transformation for a Sustainable World", set the stage for three days of
intense discussions on cutting-edge technologies that are shaping our global digital landscape. The ITU-WTSA 24
saw the largest submissions ever in Kaleidoscope at 142 of which 100 have come from India and 40 from rest of
the world.

This academic conference aims to unite scholars, industry professionals, and policymakers to explore the role of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs).

The conference will provide a platform for discussion on technological innovations and their implications for policy,
regulation, and legal and ethical frameworks. This fifteenth edition of the ITU Kaleidoscope series will facilitate
collaboration and debate on emerging trends that contribute to a digital and sustainable transformation benefiting
humanity.

                                                                               Page 2 of 3

The opening plenary session began with a warm welcome from key dignitaries. Seizo Onoe, Director of the ITU
Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, along with Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Secretary-T, Department of
Telecommunications (DoT), India, and Deb Kumar Chakrabarti, Director General, National Communication
Academy, DoT and General Chairman of Kaleidoscope 2024, highlighted the vital importance of global
collaboration in shaping standards and policies to harness the full potential of emerging technologies. The plenary
set the tone for the discussions to follow, underscoring the need for inclusivity, sustainability, and digital equity.

A Coffee-Table Book titled 155India and ITU was also released on the occasion by Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Secretary (T)
and Seizo Onoe, Director of the ITU (TSB).

In his inaugural address, Dr. Neeraj Mittal, Secretary (T), Department of Telecommunications said Todays
gathering we have witnessed is unity in diversity where we have universities, the industry, research institutions, all
of them have come together in an effort to make sure that India leads in a very sustainable, trustworthy, cooperative
approach to next-generation technologies to ensure that we have ubiquitous meaningful connectivity for every
citizen of the world.

He also urged ITU to introduce a special programme aimed at bridging the gap between research and product,
seeking avenues to bring telecom productization in a standardised manner, as we have a plethora of ideas ready to
reach the market.

"Academia and industry are key partners in research and development as well as bringing the latest innovations to
market," said Seizo Onoe, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau. "Kaleidoscope supports
this collaboration with the aim of bringing more strength to ITU standards and greater impact to research. I thank
India once again for its outstanding support."

In his opening remarks, Mr. Deb Kumar Chakrabarti, DG, National Communications Academy, Department of
Telecommunications said, This event goes beyond theoretical exploration, offering impactful dialogue that
contributes directly to global standardization. In the face of unprecedented challenges like climate change and
social inequality, it is critical that technological innovation serves the broader good and benefits all members of
society. Together, we will drive innovation that supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals."

Key Sessions of Day 1

The first day saw technical sessions focused on next-generation network architectures. These sessions featured
innovations across a variety of technological domains, demonstrating the diverse research being conducted
globally.

Session 1 included thought-provoking presentations such as "Research on Scenario-Based Dynamic Inspection
Methodology Using Expression Engine" by Jian Wu and colleagues from China Mobile. This research, focused on
network security, underscored the growing importance of dynamic inspection for mobile communications as
networks become more complex and decentralized.

Another highlight was Kyamelia Roys presentation from Jadavpur University on "Potato Plant Leaf Disease
Detection Using Custom CNN Deep Net." This innovative application of AI in sustainable agriculture showcased the
role of deep learning in advancing food security, a critical issue as the world faces climate challenges.

Quantum technologies also found a place on Day 1, with Vivek Kumar from Indias Centre for Development of
Telematics presenting on the "Hong-Ou-Mandel Dip Measurement of Two Independent Weak Coherent Pulses."
This presentation highlighted advances in quantum communication, which hold potential to revolutionize data
security through quantum cryptography.

Poster Sessions: A Platform for Future Collaboration

Following the presentations, the poster sessions provided a vibrant platform for deeper discussions and networking.
This session featured several posters, including Abhinav Kumar Singhs exploration of 6G networks with a poster

                                                                               Page 3 of 3

                                     TRANSFORMATION

titled "Performance Evaluation of STAR-RIS and AF Relay in NOMA-Enabled V2V Networks for 6G." The posters
covered a wide range of topics, from network virtualization to resilient telecommunication infrastructure for disaster
management.

Among the highlights was Suryash Gautams poster on building resilient telecom infrastructure in the wake of
Cyclone Biparjoy. The presentation offered critical lessons for future disaster preparedness and resilience
planning, drawing attention to the role of telecommunications in supporting emergency services during natural
disasters.

Focus on 6G Technologies and Beyond

The afternoon sessions saw deeper dives into emerging network technologies with Session 2 on "Technology and
Next-Generation Network Architectures." Prof. Kiran Kuchi from IIT Hyderabad delivered a powerful talk on
Advancing 6G: Key Candidate Technologies and IMT-2030 Framework, outlining the roadmap for future mobile
networks. His presentation explored key technologies such as millimeter-wave, terahertz communication, and
intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), which are expected to drive 6G standards.

Day 1 concluded with an exciting session on quantum-resilient encryption techniques, featuring Sameer Kant from
IIT Patna. His presentation, "Quantum-Resistant Encryption for Secure End-To-End Communication," highlighted
the increasing importance of quantum-safe encryption in safeguarding critical communication infrastructure from
future quantum threats.

Overall, Day 1 of ITU Kaleidoscope 2024 ended on a high note, with researchers, industry leaders, and
policymakers setting the groundwork for the innovative discussions that lie ahead in the next two days.
