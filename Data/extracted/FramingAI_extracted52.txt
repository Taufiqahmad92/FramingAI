space, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap
Management Inc. and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, in an all-cash transaction which values the
Company at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion (the "Proposed transaction"). Advent will acquire all

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 6

the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any Multiple Voting Shares (collectively the "Shares")
that are not Rollover Shares1, for a price of $34.00 per Share, in cash. This price represents an attractive and
significant premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") on March 15, 2024, the last trading day prior to media reports concerning a
potential transaction involving the Company, and a premium of approximately 48% to the 90-day volume weighted
average trading price per Subordinate Voting Share as of such date.The Proposed transaction will be implemented
by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction
was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024 and received court approval on June 20,
2024. The Proposed transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory
approvals (a majority of which were received and/or for which the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof,
with a limited number of approvals remaining outstanding), is not subject to any financing condition and, assuming
the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2024.Following completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be delisted from
each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that Nuvei will cease to be a reporting issuer in all
applicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC").Cash DividendNuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has
authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per Subordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share, payable
on December 12, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 26, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is
expected to be approximately $14 million, to be funded from the Company's existing cash on hand. In accordance
with the Plan of arrangement, shareholders are entitled to dividends with a record date prior to the effective date of
the Proposed transaction. Should the Proposed transaction be completed before the record date, the dividend will
not be paid. Accordingly, payment of the dividend will be made on December 12, 2024 if the Proposed transaction
is not completed prior to the record date of November 26, 2024.The Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax
Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial legislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, and any future dividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to
report such dividends as a dividend to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to
applicable limitations, dividends paid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as
"qualified dividend income" and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S.
shareholder should talk to its advisor regarding such dividends, including with respect to the "extraordinary
dividend" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).The declaration, timing, amount and payment of future
dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, as more fully described under the heading "Forward-
Looking Information" of this press release.Conference Call, Financial Outlook and Growth TargetsIn light of the
Proposed transaction, Nuvei no longer holds earnings conference calls or provides a financial outlook or growth
targets.About NuveiNuvei (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI) is the Canadian fintech company accelerating the business

IFRS and Other Financial MeasuresNuvei's condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the preparation of interim financial statements, including IAS 34,
Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the IASB. The information presented in this press release includes non-
IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share,
Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume. These measures are not recognized measures under
IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to
complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from our perspective.
Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's
financial statements reported under IFRS. These measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of
our operating performance and thus highlight trends in Nuvei's business that may not otherwise be apparent when
relying solely on IFRS measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties
frequently use these non-IFRS and other financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 6
                                    Nuvei Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results

measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating
budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. We believe these measures
are important additional measures of our performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used
widely among others in the payment technology industry as a means of evaluating a company's underlying
operating performance.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means
to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and
amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related
payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other.Adjusted EBITDA less
capital expenditures:We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which we define as acquisition of
intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our operating
performance.Adjusted net income:We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and
profitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before
acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign
currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax expense or
recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-classified
common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated amortization of
deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.Non-IFRS Financial RatiosAdjusted net income per basic
share and per diluted share:We use Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share as an indicator of
performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per
diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the
basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, respectively. The
number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the
Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under
IFRS.Supplementary Financial MeasuresWe monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate
our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make
strategic decisions. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key
performance indicators used by other companies.Total volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of
performance of our business. Total volume and similar measures are used widely among others in the payments
industry as a means of evaluating a company's performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of
transactions processed in the period by customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not
represent revenue earned by us. Total volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the
settlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but
are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions
processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based,
generated from merchants' daily sales and through various fees for value-added services provided to our
customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our revenue.Forward-Looking InformationThis press

ability to pay dividends, as well as make share repurchases, will be subject to applicable laws and contractual
restrictions contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including our credit facility. Any of the
foregoing may have the result of restricting future dividends or share repurchases.Consequently, all of the forward-
looking information contained herein is qualified by the foregoing cautionary statements, and there can be no
