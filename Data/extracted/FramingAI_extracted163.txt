Body

The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024.

"The Hartford delivered an excellent quarter with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4 percent," said The
Hartford's Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. "Commercial Lines once again generated strong top-line growth at
highly profitable margins, Personal Lines continues to make progress toward restoring target profitability in auto,
Group Benefits margin remained strong, and all businesses benefited from a consistent contribution from the
investment portfolio."

The Hartford's Chief Financial Officer Beth Costello said, "Commercial Lines had an excellent quarter with an
underlying combined ratio of 88.6. Pricing, excluding workers' compensation, at 9.5 percent in the quarter remains
above loss cost trends. Personal Lines generated a 7.0-point improvement in the auto underlying combined ratio.
Group Benefits continued to outperform with a core earnings margin of 8.7 percent, driven by strong results in life
and disability."

Swift continued, "The Hartford's performance through the first nine months of 2024 is a powerful example of
sustained financial excellence even in the face of industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses. With strong capital
generation, we are pleased to announce an 11 percent increase in our quarterly common dividend. Our franchise
has never been better positioned to sustain industry-leading financial performance and create value for all our
stakeholders."

Third quarter 2024 net income available to common stockholders of $761 million, or $2.56 per diluted share,
improved from $645 million in third quarter 2023, primarily driven by double-digit earned premium growth in both
Commercial and Personal Lines, lower net realized losses, higher net investment income, and improvement in the
P&C CAY before CATs loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, partially offset by elevated CAY CAT losses and a
higher expense ratio. Included in the third quarter 2024 net income was a benefit of $26 million, before tax, from
amortization of a deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance related to an adverse development cover for Navigators
pertaining to 2018 and prior accident years (Navigator's ADC).

Third quarter 2024 core earnings of $752 million, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared with $708 million of core
earnings in third quarter 2023. Contributing to the results were:
    •    An increase in earnings generated by 11% growth in P&C earned premium.
    •    Net investment income of $659 million, before tax, compared with $597 million in third quarter 2023,
         primarily driven by higher yields on our fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets.
    •    Personal Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.8 improved 6.9 points compared with 83.7 in
         third quarter 2023, including a change from unfavorable PYD of 0.1 points in 2023 to favorable PYD of 1.6
         points in 2024 and 1.6 points of higher CATs. Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio* of 68.0
         improved 6.7 points from third quarter 2023, largely due to the impact of earned pricing increases, lower
         frequency in auto physical damage and lower frequency in homeowners.
    •    Group Benefits loss ratio of 70.2 was flat with third quarter 2023, primarily driven by a lower group life loss
         ratio offset by a higher disability loss ratio, as well as a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products.
    •    P&C CAY CAT losses of $247 million, before tax, in third quarter 2024, primarily driven by hurricane
         losses, including $104 million from Hurricane Helene, compared with CAY CAT losses of $184 million in
         third quarter 2023.
    •    Commercial Lines loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.0 compared with 58.9 in third quarter 2023,
         including 0.5 points of less favorable PYD and 0.9 points of higher CATs. Underlying loss and loss
         adjustment expense ratio of 57.3 compared with 56.6 in third quarter 2023, with the increase largely due a
         higher general liability loss ratio, partially offset by lower non-CAT property losses.

                                                                                                Page 3 of 21

    •    Net favorable prior accident year development (PYD) in core earnings of $24 million, before tax, in 2024
         compared with net favorable PYD of $43 million in core earnings in 2023. Net favorable PYD in third
         quarter 2024 primarily included reserve reductions in workers' compensation and personal auto physical
         damage, partially offset by reserve increases in general liability and commercial auto liability.
    •    The expense ratios increased across P&C and Group Benefits from third quarter 2023, primarily driven by
         higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, and higher marketing spend in Personal Lines.

Sept. 30, 2024, book value per diluted share of $56.39 increased 14.1%, from $49.43 at Dec. 31, 2023, principally
due to net income in excess of stockholder dividends through Sept. 30, 2024 and lower net unrealized losses on
investments within AOCI driven by lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads, partially offset by the dilutive
effect of share repurchases.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) of $63.17 as of Sept. 30, 2024, increased 7.4%, from $58.83 at Dec.
31, 2023, as the impact from net income in excess of stockholder dividends through Sept. 30, 2024, was partially
offset by the dilutive effect of share repurchases.

Net income available to common stockholders' ROE (net income ROE) for the 12-month period ending Sept. 30,
2024, was 20.0%, an increase of 2.3 points from third quarter 2023, primarily due to an increase in 12-month trailing
net income available to common stockholders.

Core earnings ROE for the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2024, was 17.4%, an increase of 2.5 points from third
quarter 2023 due to higher trailing 12-month core earnings.

Third quarter 2024 net income of $528 million compared with net income of $519 million in third quarter 2023,
principally due to the impact of earned premium growth and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher
CAY CAT losses, an increase in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, higher incentive
compensation and benefits costs, and less favorable PYD. PYD includes a $26 million, before-tax, benefit due to
the amortization of the deferred gain related to the Navigators ADC.

Commercial Lines core earnings of $534 million in third quarter 2024 compared with $542 million in third quarter
2023. Contributing to the results were:
    •    10% growth in earned premium.
    •    Net investment income of $442 million, before tax, compared with $395 million in third quarter 2023.
    •    CAY CAT losses of $155 million, before tax, in third quarter 2024, primarily from hurricanes and tropical
         storms, including $55 million from Hurricane Helene, as well as wind and hail events across several
         regions of the United States, up from CAY CAT losses of $115 million in third quarter 2023.
    •    An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 57.3, in third quarter 2024 compared with 56.6 in
         third quarter 2023, with the increase primarily driven by a higher general liability loss ratio, partially offset
         by lower non-CAT property losses.
    •    Net favorable PYD within core earnings of $10 million, before tax, in third quarter 2024, compared with $46
         million of net favorable PYD within core earnings in third quarter 2023. The net favorable PYD in third
         quarter 2024 primarily includes reserve reductions in workers' compensation, partially offset by reserve
         increases in general liability and auto liability.

Combined ratio of 92.2 compared with 90.2 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to a 2.1 point increase in the loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio, including 0.5 points of less favorable PYD (including 0.8 points of favorable
development related to the amortization of the deferred gain) and 0.9 points of higher CAY CAT losses. Underlying
combined ratio of 88.6 compared with 87.8 in third quarter 2023 primarily due to a 0.7 point increase in the
underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio.
    •    Small Commercial combined ratio of 91.6 compared with 87.7 in third quarter 2023, including 3.2 points of
         higher CAY CATs and 1.1 points of less favorable PYD. Underlying combined ratio of 89.3 improved 0.4
         points compared with 89.7 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to lower non-CAT property losses, partially
         offset by a higher loss ratio in general liability.
    •    Middle & Large Commercial combined ratio of 97.0 compared with 94.5 in third quarter 2023, driven by 1.5
         points of more unfavorable PYD, partially offset by 1.0 points of lower CAY CATs. Underlying combined
         ratio of 90.2 compared with 88.1 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to higher non-CAT property losses and
         a higher loss ratio in general liability and auto, partially offset by a lower expense ratio and the benefit of a
         shift in premium mix toward property lines.
    •    Global Specialty combined ratio of 87.4 improved 1.5 points compared with 88.9 in third quarter 2023,
         driven by a change from unfavorable PYD of 0.3 in 2023 to favorable PYD of 1.7 points in 2024 and 0.5
         points of lower CAY CATs. The combined ratio included 2.9 points of favorable development due to the
         amortization of the deferred gain related to the Navigators ADC. Underlying combined ratio of 85.3
         compared with 84.3 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to a higher loss ratio in global reinsurance and a
         higher expense ratio.

Third quarter 2024 written premiums of $3.3 billion were up 9% from third quarter 2023, with increases across the
segment, strong double-digit new business growth in Middle Market and Small Commercial, and the effect of
renewal written price increases.

by improved underwriting results and an increase in net investment income. Contributing to the improved
underwriting results was a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.8, improving by 6.9 points compared
with 83.7 in third quarter 2023, and the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by a higher expense ratio.

Personal Lines core earnings of $33 million improved from a core loss of $8 million in third quarter 2023.
Contributing to the results were:
    •    An underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.0 in third quarter 2024, which improved 6.7
         points from 74.7 in third quarter 2023, primarily driven by the impact of earned pricing increases and
         improvement in auto physical damage frequency and homeowners frequency.
    •    13% growth in earned premium.
    •    $14 million, before tax, of favorable PYD in third quarter of 2024, compared with $1 million of unfavorable
         PYD in third quarter 2023. The net favorable PYD in third quarter 2024 is driven by reserve reductions in
         auto physical damage and homeowners.
    •    Net investment income of $58 million, before tax, in third quarter 2024 compared with $47 million in third
         quarter 2023.
    •    CAY CAT losses of $92 million, before tax, in third quarter 2024, primarily from hurricanes and tropical
         storms, including $49 million from Hurricane Helene, as well as wind and hail events across several
         regions of the United States, up from $69 million of CAY CAT losses in third quarter 2023.

Combined ratio of 102.5 in third quarter 2024, improved from 107.9 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to a 6.9 point
improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, including a 6.7 point improvement in the underlying loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio and a change from unfavorable PYD of 0.1 points in 2023 to favorable PYD of
1.6 points in 2024, partially offset by 1.6 points of higher CAY CAT losses. Underlying combined ratio of 93.7
improved 5.3 points from 99.0 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to improvement in the underlying loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in auto and homeowners, partially offset by a 1.4 point increase in the expense ratio,
largely driven by higher commissions and marketing expenses.
    •    Auto combined ratio of 105.7 improved from 110.8 in third quarter 2023. The underlying combined ratio of
         101.5 improved 7.0 points from 108.5 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to improvement in underlying loss
         and loss adjustment expense ratio driven by the impact of double-digit earned pricing increases as well as
         lower physical damage claim frequency, partially offset by higher auto claim severities. The auto physical
         damage claim severity trend has moderated from the prior year. The auto liability severity increases
         continue to recognize the inflationary effects and higher attorney representation rates on bodily injury
         claims.
    •    Homeowners combined ratio of 94.7 improved from 101.4 in third quarter 2023. The underlying combined
         ratio of 75.4 improved 2.7 points from 78.1 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to improvement in
         underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio driven by the impact of double-digit earned pricing and
         lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher claim severities. Contributing to the higher homeowners
         severity was the effect of higher rebuilding costs.

                                                                                                Page 6 of 21

    •    The expense ratio of 25.6 increased 1.4 points from third quarter 2023, primarily driven by higher direct
         marketing costs, higher commissions, and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of
         higher earned premium.

Written premiums in third quarter 2024 were $970 million compared with $869 million in third quarter 2023 with:
    •    Renewal written price increases in auto and homeowners of 20.8% and 15.2%, respectively, in response to
         elevated loss cost trends.
    •    An increase in new business in both homeowners and auto from third quarter 2023 of $35 million, or 140%,
         and $22 million, or 36%, respectively.
    •    Lower effective policy count retention in auto due to renewal written price increases.

Net income of $156 million in third quarter 2024 increased from $146 million in third quarter 2023, largely driven by
higher fully insured premiums, the absence of net realized losses in the 2024 period, and a lower group life loss
ratio, partially offset by a higher expense ratio, a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher
group disability loss ratio. Core earnings of $154 million compared with $170 million in third quarter 2023, primarily
driven by a higher expense ratio, a higher loss ratio on supplemental health products, and a higher group disability
loss ratio, partially offset by higher fully insured premiums and a lower group life loss ratio.

Fully insured ongoing premiums were up 2% compared with third quarter 2023, including an increase in exposure
on existing accounts, new business sales, and persistency in excess of 90%, though slightly below the prior year
period. Fully insured ongoing sales were $105 million in third quarter 2024, compared with $143 million in third
quarter 2023, driven by lower group disability and group life sales.

Loss ratio of 70.2 was flat with third quarter 2023.
    •    Group life loss ratio of 77.5 improved 2.7 points largely driven by lower mortality.
    •    Group disability loss ratio of 67.9 compared with 67.3 in third quarter 2023, driven by a higher loss ratio in
         paid family and medical leave products, partially offset by a favorable change in the long-term disability
         recovery rate assumption of 2.2 points.

Expense ratio of 25.3 compared with 24.0 in third quarter 2023, primarily due to higher staffing costs, including
higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, and increased investments in technology.

Net investment income of $119 million, before tax, compared with $121 million in third quarter 2023.

Third quarter 2024 consolidated net investment income of $659 million compared with $597 million in third quarter
2023, primarily due to the impact of reinvesting at higher rates and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset
by lower income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments (LPs).

Third quarter 2024 net investment income, excluding LPs*, of $622 million, before tax, compared to $525 million in
third quarter 2023, an 18% increase driven by a higher level of invested assets combined with a 40 basis point
increase in annualized yield.

before tax, in third quarter 2023.

Total invested assets of $59.4 billion increased $3.4 billion from Dec. 31, 2023, primarily due to a net increase in
book value as well as higher valuations on fixed maturities driven by lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Hartford uses non-GAAP financial measures in this news release to assist investors in analyzing the
company's operating performance for the periods presented herein. Because The Hartford's calculation of these
measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing
The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other
financial measures used in this news release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial
Supplement for third quarter 2024, which is available on The Hartford's website, https://ir.thehartford.com .

Annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments - This non-GAAP
measure is calculated as (a) the annualized net investment income, on a Consolidated, P&C or Group Benefits
level, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, divided by (b) the monthly average invested
assets at amortized cost, as applicable, excluding derivatives book value and limited partnerships and other
alternative investments. The Company believes that annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships and
other alternative investments, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings
because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative
investments. Annualized investment yield is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the
annualized investment yield to annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternatives
investments for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is provided in the table below.

Book value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) - This is a non-GAAP per share measure that is calculated by
dividing (a) common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive
potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the
Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes
that excluding AOCI from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can
fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted
share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. A reconciliation of book value per diluted share to book
value per diluted share (excluding AOCI) is provided in the table below.

Core earnings - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the
Company's operating performance. The Hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable
measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and
financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items. Therefore, the
following items are excluded from core earnings:
    •    Certain realized gains and losses - Generally realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment
         decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the
         insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all
         realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market

                                                                                              Page 13 of 21

        conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to
        our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic
        settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting
        item included in the income statement such as net investment income.
    •   Restructuring and other costs - Costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating
        expense of the business.
    •   Loss on extinguishment of debt - Largely consisting of make-whole payments or tender premiums upon
        paying debt off before maturity, these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
    •   Gains and losses on reinsurance transactions - Gains or losses on reinsurance, such as those entered into
        upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves, are not a recurring operating expense of the business.
    •   Integration and other non-recurring M&A costs - These costs, including transaction costs incurred in
        connection with an acquired business, are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an
        ongoing operating expense of the business.
    •   Change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business - These changes in loss reserves are excluded
        from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the
        acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition.
    •   Deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain -
        Retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and excluding the deferred
        gain on retroactive reinsurance and related amortization of the deferred gain from core earnings provides
        greater insight into the economics of the business.
    •   Change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non-core components of before tax income -
        These changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non-core
        components of before tax income, such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards.
    •   Results of discontinued operations - These results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or
        held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our
        ongoing businesses.

In addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core
earnings, preferred stock dividends declared, which are excluded from net income, are included in the
determination of core earnings. Preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on
debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding.

Net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measures to core earnings. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or
net income (loss) available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's
business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), net income
(loss) available to common stockholders, and core earnings when reviewing the Company's performance.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,

Services Group, Inc. Consolidating Income Statements."

Core earnings margin - The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it
is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is
calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income
margin, calculated by dividing net income by revenues, is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The
Company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of
Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and
realized gains (losses) as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings. Core earnings margin

Core earnings per diluted share - This non-GAAP per share measure is calculated using the non-GAAP financial
measure core earnings rather than the GAAP measure net income. The Company believes that core earnings per
diluted share provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same
reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income (loss) available to common stockholders
per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings per diluted share should
not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share
and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company believes that it is
useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share and
core earnings per diluted share when reviewing the Company's performance. A reconciliation of net income
available to common stockholders per diluted common share to core earnings per diluted share for the quarterly
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is provided in the table below.

Core Earnings Return on Equity - The Company provides different measures of the return on stockholders' equity
(ROE). Core earnings ROE is calculated based on non-GAAP financial measures. Core earnings ROE is calculated
by dividing (a) the non-GAAP measure core earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters by (b) the non-GAAP measure

average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. Net income ROE is the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP measure. The Company excludes AOCI in the calculation of core earnings ROE to provide investors with a
measure of how effectively the Company is investing the portion of the Company's net worth that is primarily
attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company provides to investors return on equity measures
based on its non-GAAP core earnings financial measure for the reasons set forth in the core earnings definition. A
quantitative reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders ROE to core earnings ROE is not
calculable on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized gains and
losses, which typically vary substantially from period to period.

Underlying combined ratio- This non-GAAP financial measure of underwriting results represents the combined ratio
before catastrophes, prior accident year development and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes
this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and
unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development.
The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are excluded from underlying combined ratio because
such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior
to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors' ability to assess the Company's financial
performance. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the underlying combined ratio for individual reporting
segments can be found in this news release under the heading "Business Results" for Commercial Lines" and
"Personal Lines". A reconciliation of the combined ratio to underlying combined ratio for lines of business within the
Company's P&C reporting segments is set forth below.

Underwriting gain (loss) - The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines
segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax non-GAAP
measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting
expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced
significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over
time is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage
exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of
reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides
investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are
managed separately from the Company's investing activities. A reconciliation of net income to underwriting gain
(loss) for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is set forth below.

Underlying underwriting gain (loss) - This non-GAAP measure of underwriting profitability represents underwriting
gain (loss) before current accident year catastrophes, PYD and current accident year change in loss reserves upon
acquisition of a business. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The Company
believes underlying underwriting gain (loss) is important to understand the Company's periodic earnings because
the volatile and unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and prior accident year reserve
development could obscure underwriting trends. The changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are
also excluded from underlying underwriting gain (loss) because such changes could obscure the ability to compare
results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our
investors' ability to assess the Company's financial performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to underlying
underwriting gain (loss) for individual reporting segments for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, is set forth below.

Underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio - This non-GAAP financial measure of the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio for Commercial Lines and Personal Lines represents the loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. The loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is an
important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe
losses and prior accident year reserve development. A reconciliation of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
to the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, is set forth below.

Net investment income, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments -This non-GAAP measure
is the amount of net investment income, on a Consolidated, P&C or Group Benefits level earned from invested
assets, excluding the net investment income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The
Company believes that net investment income, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative instruments,
provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of
the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative instruments. Net investment income is
the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of net investment income to net investment income
excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments for the quarterly periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 is provided in the table below.
