PR NewswireProactive Security Technology Will Protect Patients and Stafffrom Gun-Related
ThreatsPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ZeroEyes, the creators of the only AI-based gun detection
video analytics platform that holds the US Department of Homeland Security SAFETY Act Designation, today
announced the deployment of its AI gun detection and intelligent situational awareness solution at Columbus,
Georgia's Lane Dermatology & Dermatologic Surgery to protect patients and staff against gun-related violence. This
marks the first private healthcare practice to adopt ZeroEyes' proactive security technology.

 With the rise of gun-related workplace violence in the United States, healthcare facilities face growing security
challenges. While they must remain accessible to visitors and new patients, this open-door policy increases the risk
of violence. Lane Dermatology & Dermatologic Surgery is proactively addressing these threats by enhancing its
security systems with ZeroEyes. By adopting the pioneering technology, the practice ensures preparedness for
active shooter scenarios, providing an additional layer of protection while maintaining a welcoming
environment."Having a background in counterterrorism and disaster medicine, along with my experience as a flight
surgeon in the Air Force, I understand the critical importance of being prepared for active shooter scenarios," said
Dr. Joshua E. Lane, co-founder of Lane Dermatology & Dermatologic Surgery. "As a small business, we are
implementing ZeroEyes' technology because it buys valuable time for survival during such incidents. With
ZeroEyes, we hope to set a new security standard for healthcare facilities across the country."Lane Dermatology &
Dermatologic Surgery was founded in 2007 by Drs. Joshua and Tanda Lane and is a full-service dermatology,
dermatologic surgery and aesthetics practice. The facility focuses on medical and surgical care of the skin, as well
as laser and aesthetic enhancements. Both Dr. Joshua and Tanda Lane are board-certified by the American
Academy of Dermatology, and Dr. Joshua Lane is the only fellowship-trained Mohs micrographic and reconstructive
surgeon in the city.ZeroEyes' AI gun detection and intelligent situational awareness software is layered on existing
digital security cameras. If a gun is identified, images will instantly be shared with the ZeroEyes Operations Center
(ZOC), the industry's only U.S.-based, fully in-house operation center, which is staffed 24/7/365 by specially trained
U.S. military and law enforcement veterans. If these experts determine that the threat is valid, they will dispatch
alerts and actionable intelligence, including visual description, gun type, and last known location, to law
enforcement and local staff as quickly as 3 to 5 seconds from detection."Private healthcare practices often face
significant financial constraints when it comes to implementing security measures," said Mike Lahiff, CEO and co-
founder of ZeroEyes. "ZeroEyes serves as a valuable force multiplier, allowing facilities to reduce costs on security
