Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY), a global organizational consulting firm, today announced first quarter fee revenue of
$674.9 million. In addition, first quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.17 and adjusted diluted earnings per
share was $1.18.

"I am pleased with our first quarter results, as we generated $675 million in fee revenue," said Gary D. Burnison.
"Earnings and profitability increased year over year as we delivered $111 million of Adjusted EBITDA, at a 16.5%
margin, which is our fifth consecutive quarter of profitability improvement.

"Our sustained success stems from a balanced approach - from our colleagues and IP to our diversified strategy
and broad offerings. As a result, our topline is more than 30 percent higher than before the pandemic, with even
greater profitability. During the quarter, Consulting and Digital maintained their positive momentum, with improved
growth in Executive Search and stable trends across Professional Search permanent placement and RPO. We are
also confident about the future, as evidenced by our capital allocation, which not only included share buybacks but
also more than a twofold increase in our quarterly dividend year over year. Moving forward, we will continue to
transform the business to enable our clients to Be More Than."

The Company reported fee revenue in Q1 FY'25 of $674.9 million, a decrease of 3% (down 2% on a constant
currency basis) compared to Q1 FY'24. The decrease in fee revenue was primarily due to lower fee revenues in
Professional Search & Interim and RPO driven by a decline in demand due to the current economic environment,
partially offset by an increase in Executive Search fee revenue.

Operating income was $76.1 million (at an operating margin of 11.3%) in Q1 FY'25, compared to $56.8 million (at
an operating margin of 8.1%) in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 320bps. Net income attributable to Korn Ferry
was $62.6 million in Q1 FY'25, compared to $46.6 million in Q1 FY'24. Adjusted EBITDA was $111.2 million in Q1
FY'25 compared to $95.7 million in Q1 FY'24. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5% in Q1 FY'25, an increase of
280bps.

Operating income, margin, and net income attributable to Korn Ferry increased as a result of strong cost
management, coupled with the lower cost of services expense compared to the year-ago quarter. These decreases
in expenses were partially offset by the decrease in fee revenue discussed above.

Adjusted EBITDA and margin increased due to the same factors above but excluded integration/acquisition costs.

Fee revenue was $208.6 million in Q1 FY'25, an increase of $3.4 million or 2% compared to Q1 FY'24 (up 3% on a
constant currency basis). The increase in fee revenue was primarily driven by a 4% increase in the number of
engagements billed in our North America region.

Adjusted EBITDA was $49.4 million in Q1 FY'25 compared to $42.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased by 300bps to 23.7% in Q1 FY'25. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted

Fee revenue was $88.5 million in Q1 FY'25, a decrease of $7.2 million or 8% (down 7% on a constant currency
basis) compared to the year-ago quarter. RPO fee revenue decreased due to moderation in the hiring volume in the
existing base of clients due to the current economic environment.

Adjusted EBITDA was $12.5 million in Q1 FY'25 compared to $10.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased 320bps to 14.1% in Q1 FY'25. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin both resulted from greater execution staff productivity and strong cost management.

Outlook

Assuming worldwide geopolitical conditions, economic conditions, financial markets and foreign exchange rates
remain steady, on a consolidated basis:
    •        Q2 FY'25 fee revenue is expected to be in the range of $655 million and $685 million; and
    •        Q2 FY'25 diluted earnings per share is expected to range between $1.11 to $1.23.

On a consolidated adjusted basis:

    •    Constant currency (calculated using a quarterly average) percentages that represent the percentage
         change that would have resulted had exchange rates in the prior period been the same as those in effect in
         the current period; and
    •    Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA, which is earnings before interest, taxes,
         depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude integration/acquisition costs, impairment of fixed
         assets, impairment of right-of-use assets and restructuring charges, net when applicable, and Consolidated
         and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA margin.

This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial
information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP
performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release provides meaningful
supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance by excluding certain charges that may not be
indicative of Korn Ferry's ongoing operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are performance
measures and are not indicative of the liquidity of Korn Ferry. These charges, which are described in the footnotes
in the attached reconciliations, represent 1) costs we incurred to acquire and integrate a portion of our Professional
Search & Interim business, 2) impairment of fixed assets associated with the decision to terminate and sublease
some of our offices, 3) impairment of right-of-use assets due to the decision to terminate and sublease some of our
offices and 4) restructuring charges, net to realign our workforce with the Company's business needs and
objectives. The use of non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry's historical performance.
Korn Ferry includes non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in
allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of
Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted net income attributable to
Korn Ferry, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share and Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted
EBITDA, exclude certain charges that management does not consider on-going in nature and allows management
and investors to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results.
Management further believes that Consolidated and Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors
because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among
companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of
which can vary substantially from company to company. In the case of constant currency percentages,
management believes the presentation of such information provides useful supplemental information regarding
Korn Ferry's performance as excluding the impact of exchange rate changes on Korn Ferry's financial performance
allows investors to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results, to
better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by exchange rate changes and to
perform related trend analysis, and provides a higher degree of transparency of information used by management
in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making.
