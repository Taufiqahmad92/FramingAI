PR NewswireBOSTON, Oct. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of
energy management and automation, today announced the latest results of its Schneider Sustainability Impact
(SSI) program and its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.Recently recognized as theWorld's Most
Sustainable Company by TIME and Statista, Schneider Electric's SSI program monitors and measures the
company's progress across a range of transformative Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targets set for
2025. By tracking its sustainability performance and publishing quarterly results, Schneider Electric keeps the
momentum for its 11 global and local ambitions and maintains its industry leadership in corporate social
responsibility.At the end of the quarter, the overall Schneider Electric Sustainability Impact (SSI) score came in at
7.29 out of ten, well on track to reach the 2024 end-year target of 7.40, with two major milestones reached:

Schneider surpassed its goal of providing access to green and reliable energy to 50 million people more than one
year before its end-2025 target. This was achieved through projects where Schneider's solar power solutions were
installed on public facilities across Africa and India. For example, in Kenya, Nigeria, and India, new hybrid solar
solutions were added to health clinics attended by roughly 2 million people, and, in India, over 700 schools were
powered by clean energy benefitting around 120,000 students. Schneider is now focused on further ramping up
these efforts so that by 2030, cumulatively, 100 million people will have gained access to green electricity since the
start of the program in 2009.Schneider also crossed a key threshold in its efforts to foster learning, upskilling, and
development for all generations having now trained over 763,000 people in energy management. For example,
Schneider Electric and its Foundation recently collaborated with Enactus, enabling university students from ten
countries to develop entrepreneurial solutions that address social issues related to the energy
transition.Furthermore, Schneider made considerable strides in halving the carbon impact of its top suppliers
through its Zero Carbon Project, resulting in a 36% reduction of their operational CO2 emissions. This was
facilitated by several renewable energy workshops held in the USA, Europe, and China, as well as over 20
specialized webinars aimed at supporting suppliers in their decarbonization endeavors."Our achievements this
quarter showcase the scale of our impact, with local projects playing a pivotal role in achieving our ambitious
goals," said Xavier Denoly, Schneider Electric's Senior Vice-President of Sustainable Development. "Despite these
great results, our work is far from over. We must further intensify our global decarbonization efforts to mitigate the
effects of climate change, benefiting people and planet."Expanding Renewable Energy Through Strategic
InvestmentEarlier this year, Schneider Electric signed a groundbreaking Tax Credit Transfer Agreement as part of
a strategic partnership with ENGIE North America. This collaboration supports solar and battery storage systems

      Schneider's sustainability program heads full speed toward its end-year targets with strong local impact

for clean energy projects across Texas. These projects, which have been progressively activated throughout 2024,
have propelled Schneider Electric closer to its goal of 100% renewable energy usage in the U.S. and Canada. In
recognition of these efforts, Schneider Electric was awarded the 2024 RE100 Changemaker Award during Climate
Week NYC for its significant progress toward ambitious renewable energy targets.Supporting Local Communities
through Sustainable Housing and Disaster ReliefReaffirming its commitment to community-driven impact,
Schneider Electric has strengthened its 30+ year partnership with Habitat for Humanity. This year, the collaboration
has expanded beyond affordable housing to help homeowners reduce operational costs through energy monitoring,
smart products, and education for both Habitat affiliates and homeowners. Schneider Electric will contribute $3.5
million in cash and product donations this year and provide thousands of employee volunteer hours, all geared
toward advancing long-term sustainability in affordable housing.Schneider Electric's partnership with Footprint
Project, launched in 2021, highlights its dedication to energy equity in disaster relief. This year we will donate $1
million in cash and products and provide hundreds of volunteer hours. By providing funding and technical
volunteers to build solar trailers for rapid deployment in hurricane-affected regions, Schneider Electric empowers
local communities with sustainable energy solutions in times of crisis.Find more details about the results and the
