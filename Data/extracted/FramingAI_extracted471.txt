Oklahoma State University issued the following news:

Dr. Lingfeng Tao, assistant professor and coordinator of mechatronics and robotics, and Dr. He Bai, associate
professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, both from the College of Engineering, Architecture and
Technology, have received a National Science Foundation EAGER award totaling $160,000.

The award funds their research on developing advancements to telemanipulation technologies that could transform
health care, disaster response and more.

Their project aims to advance teleoperation systems for robotic hands by transitioning from basic motion imitation to
developing more intuitive and outcome-driven control systems. These advancements have the potential to
significantly impact various industries by enhancing the precision and effectiveness of remote robotic manipulation.

Innovative approach to telemanipulation

Tao and his team aim to revolutionize human-robot collaboration by integrating advanced deep reinforcement
learning algorithms and multi-modal perception systems into a bi-directional control and feedback telemanipulation
systems.

Dr. Lingfeng Tao with students Haoyang Wang and Haoran Guo who assisted with the research.

These systems integrate diverse sensory technologies, including inertial measurement units, computer vision
methods and convolutional neural networks, enabling the AI-controlled robot to accurately interpret and execute
human commands based on desired task outcomes. The systems utilize multiple feedback devices such as visual,
auditory and haptic to create a cohesive and intuitive experience for the operator. This system enhances human-
robot interaction by providing comprehensive feedback, enabling the operator to make more informed decisions and
perform tasks more effectively and safely.

                                                                                                             Page 2 of 2

"Our approach allows robots to interpret and execute human commands more accurately while minimizing the
cognitive and physical demands on operators," Tao said. "This will make telemanipulation systems much easier to
learn and use, requiring less training and making the technology more accessible across different sectors."

Applications across key industries

The potential applications of this research span several critical industries:

Health Care: Enhanced precision in telesurgery, allowing surgeons to perform delicate procedures remotely with
improved control and safety. Disaster Response: Remote handling of hazardous materials or navigating through
dangerous environments, such as collapsed structures, to perform search and rescue operations without putting
human responders at risk. Space and Deep-Sea Exploration: Conducting complex tasks in space or deep-sea
environments where direct human involvement is not feasible, such as assembling structures or repairing
equipment. Manufacturing: Automating assembly lines where precise, flexible manipulation of objects is required,
improving efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention in repetitive or dangerous tasks.

Inspiring the next generation

In addition to its industrial applications, this research is also helping to inspire future innovators. The team is actively
involved in K-12 STEM education, bringing hands-on robotics demonstrations to students through outreach
activities like 4-H Robotics Exploration Day and mentorship for the Stillwater High School Robotics Team.

"We want to inspire students by showing how advanced robotics can solve real-world problems," Tao said.

The research team is planning more educational initiatives, including summer camps and short lectures.

Looking ahead

Tao notes that the most crucial aspect of this research is its focus on enhancing human-robot collaboration in
complex and safety-critical tasks. By leveraging advanced perception systems, this research has the potential to set
new standards in telemanipulation, making human-robot teaming safer, more precise and more intuitive across
multiple industries.

"We're excited to address these challenges and create solutions that will impact industries worldwide," Bai said.
