PR NewswireThe 2024 State of AI Infrastructure Report indicates almost half of IT teams do not understand how to
protect AI applications and workloads.CHARLOTTE, N.C. , Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --Flexential, a leading
provider of secure and flexible data center solutions, unveiled new insights from its2024 State of AI Infrastructure
Report, revealing growing concern among IT leaders about the cybersecurity risks associated with AI investments.

 The findings are based on a survey of 350 IT leaders at organizations with over $100 million in annual revenue,
including 100 respondents at organizations with over $2 billion in annual revenue. The survey suggests that
organizations must address multiple challenges related to cybersecurity and data protection to achieve their AI
objectives, indicating the increased need forproactive disaster recovery planning, resilient infrastructure design and
testing, and an emphasis on reliable uptime to ensure secure, scalable, and high-performant AI
deployments.Flexential's survey found that nearly all IT leaders (95%) believe that their organization's increased
investment in AI has made them more vulnerable to cyberthreats. Shockingly, 40% of respondents said their
cybersecurity teams don't understand how to protect AI applications and workloads.Additionally, 42% of
organizations have strategically shifted AI applications and workloads away from the public cloud to colocation
environments. This move, driven by heightened data privacy and security concerns, indicates a cautious approach
among enterprises. By opting for colocation, they are ensuring tighter control over sensitive data withinon-premise
or third-party data centers and private clouds."As AI becomes more embedded into business processes, it's clear
that enterprises need help safeguarding their organization's critical data as well as educating and up-skilling their
entire staff," said Jason Carolan, Chief Innovation Officer at Flexential. "Our report findings reinforce the importance
of resilient and secure IT infrastructure solutions that can reduce vulnerability while supporting the high-
performance demands of AI workloads. Organizations need the right internal and external partners and experts in
place to help them account for these risks and alleviate the pressure on their already stretched IT teams."Other
notable findings from Flexential's report include:Over half (54%) of respondents stated that the complexity of AI
applications creates a larger, inherently more vulnerable attack surface for their organizations.Due to AI
investments, 39% of IT leaders claimed they are storing and processing more sensitive data than before.Around
half of respondents (51%) noted their AI investments have led them to move where they store sensitive data, such
as closer to the edge of the network, increasing their organizations' cybersecurity vulnerability."As AI use increases
across sectors and business functions, so do the risks that can jeopardize business operations if not properly
addressed," said Will Bass, VP of Cybersecurity Services at Flexential. "In response, enterprises need to have
robust disaster recovery strategies that go beyond basic protection measures. This includes building resiliency into
